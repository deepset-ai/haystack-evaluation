# haystack-evaluation
Using Haystack to benchmark different RAG architectures over different datasets


goal number 1 is to give user practical guidance on what techniques to try out on their dataset/use case

goal number 2 is to show that there is not a “silver bullet” type of solution, 
that it depends on the dataset and use case, but that Haystack can support them all

goal number 3 is to showcase advanced evaluation/experimentation API (most advanced compared to competitors)
