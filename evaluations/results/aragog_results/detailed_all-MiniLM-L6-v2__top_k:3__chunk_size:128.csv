As LLM capabilities continue to evolve and their use becomes more widespread, there is a growing concern about the potential for misuse, such as spreading misinformation or generating fake content. By developing a tool like DetectGPT, researchers and developers can work towards mitigating these risks by detecting and flagging text generated by LLMs.
