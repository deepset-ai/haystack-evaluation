In the first step, crowd workers were provided with training where they were given instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After the training phase, workers who annotated a minimum of five examples and achieved performance at, or above the median performance across all workers, were qualified to work on the annotation phase. In the annotation phase, workers were provided with the same instructions as the training phase and were linked to the same FAQ page. Annotations from five workers were collected for each example, and a majority vote was taken to estimate human performance.",1.0,1.0,0.8104623556137085
102,How do the selected tasks in SuperGLUE reflect the benchmark's goals for advancing language understanding technologies?,"The selected tasks, chosen for their difficulty and diversity, reflect SuperGLUE's goals by requiring substantive innovations in machine learning to improve sample-efficient transfer, multitask, and unsupervised learning, driving forward the capabilities of language understanding systems.","The selected tasks in SuperGLUE reflect the benchmark's goals for advancing language understanding technologies by including more challenging tasks, more diverse task formats beyond sentence- and sentence-pair classification, and providing comprehensive human baselines to measure performance against.",1.0,1.0,0.8704701662063599
103,"In the context of PAL, what role do meaningful variable names play in the generated program's effectiveness?","Meaningful variable names in PAL's generated code are crucial for linking programmatic steps to natural language problem entities, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code, and improving the model's reasoning and execution accuracy.","Meaningful variable names in PAL are expected to ease reasoning for the model Codex, which was trained on mostly meaningful names. This was also found by Madaan et al. (2022), indicating that meaningful variable names play an important role in the generated program's effectiveness.",1.0,1.0,0.8374701738357544
104,How does PAL address the execution of complex computations in natural language processing tasks?," PAL addresses complex computations by generating programmatic reasoning steps for LLMs and executing them via an interpreter, ensuring accurate and efficient problem-solving acros various domains.","PAL addresses the execution of complex computations in natural language processing tasks by being able to work with LMs trained for natural language with sufficiently high coding ability. It is not limited to LMs of code and can outperform other methods once the LM's code modeling ability is sufficiently high. Additionally, PAL's synergy with the interpreter is considered the main benefit rather than just having a better prompt.",1.0,1.0,0.6820135116577148
105,How does SuperGLUE's design ensure it presents a more challenging benchmark than its predecessor GLUE for evaluating language understanding models?,"SuperGLUE introduces more challenging tasks retained from GLUE, diversifies task formats beyond sentence- and sentence-pair classification to include coreference resolution and question answering, and features comprehensive human baseline performances to ensure significant headroom for model improvement.","The design of SuperGLUE ensures it presents a more challenging benchmark than its predecessor GLUE by incorporating specially marked input text, such as underlined text, that requires models to understand and process specific linguistic phenomena.",1.0,1.0,0.7171112895011902
106," In what ways does SuperGLUE expand beyond GLUE's task formats, and why is this expansion significant?","By including coreference resolution and question answering formats, SuperGLUE expands the scope of evaluated linguistic phenomena, testing models' abilities in more varied contexts and reflecting a broader range of natural language understanding challenges.","SuperGLUE expands beyond GLUE's task formats by introducing tasks that are harder or even adversarial, such as those involving restrictivity, disjunction, and downward monotone relationships. This expansion is significant because it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of human performance on a wider range of language understanding tasks.",1.0,1.0,0.7822916507720947
