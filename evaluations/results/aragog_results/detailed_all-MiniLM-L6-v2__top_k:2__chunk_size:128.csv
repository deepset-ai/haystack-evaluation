In this process, a random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token [MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy loss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uniformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possible replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token.

16,Discuss the impact of model size on BERT's performance across different tasks.,"Larger BERT models consistently show better performance across tasks, indicating the importance of model size in achieving high accuracy.","The impact of model size on BERT's performance across different tasks is significant. In the context provided, it is mentioned that the 336M model, which is the same size as BERT-large, achieves stable training with lower training loss. The 1.3B model, which is the same as the BERT-xlarge configuration, performs worse than the 336M BERT-large model. Furthermore, when the BERT model is scaled up to the 3.9B parameter case with larger hidden size and more layers, it is mentioned that it is still training after 1.5 million iterations.

This indicates that increasing the model size of BERT can lead to better performance in certain tasks, as seen with the 336M model outperforming the 1.3B model. However, it also shows that there may be diminishing returns with extremely large models like the 3.9B model, which may require longer training iterations to achieve optimal performance.
