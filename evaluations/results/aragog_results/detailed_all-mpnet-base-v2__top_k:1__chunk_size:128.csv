This strategy ensures a richer variety of training examples and prevents the model from overfitting to a specific masked pattern.","The dynamic masking strategy in RoBERTa differs from BERT's static masking by incorporating a more elaborate masking procedure. In RoBERTa, the masking is done as follows: 80% of the time a word is replaced with the [MASK] token, 10% of the time it is replaced with a random word, and 10% of the time it is kept unchanged. This dynamic masking strategy forces the Transformer encoder to maintain a distributional contextual representation of every input token.
