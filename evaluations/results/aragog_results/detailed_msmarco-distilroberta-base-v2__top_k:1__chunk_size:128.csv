106," In what ways does SuperGLUE expand beyond GLUE's task formats, and why is this expansion significant?","By including coreference resolution and question answering formats, SuperGLUE expands the scope of evaluated linguistic phenomena, testing models' abilities in more varied contexts and reflecting a broader range of natural language understanding challenges.","SuperGLUE expands beyond GLUE's task formats by including coreference resolution and question answering (QA) tasks. This expansion is significant because it introduces more diverse task formats and challenges for current NLP approaches, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance.",1.0,1.0,0.835117757320404
