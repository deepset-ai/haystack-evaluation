This approach, known as DetectGPT, introduces a new curvature-based criterion for determining if a passage is generated from a given LLM without the need for training a separate classifier, collecting real or generated passages, or watermarking generated text explicitly.

As language models continue to improve in fluency and capabilities, the need for tools to detect machine-generated content becomes increasingly important to combat the potential for misuse, such as spreading misinformation, generating fake news, or impersonating individuals. DetectGPT's approach provides a more robust and efficient solution to identifying machine-generated text, especially as LLMs evolve and become more indistinguishable from human-generated content.

Moreover, as language models advance, the potential for misuse also increases. DetectGPT's ability to detect machine-generated text can help mitigate the risks associated with the manipulation of text, ensuring that generated content is properly attributed and verified. By understanding the curvature of the log probability function in a latent semantic space, DetectGPT can effectively discern between human and machine-generated text, thereby offering a valuable tool in safeguarding against the misuse of evolving LLM capabilities.",1.0,1.0,0.7570477724075317

In this process, a random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token '[MASK]'. The MLM objective is to predict the masked tokens using a cross-entropy loss.
