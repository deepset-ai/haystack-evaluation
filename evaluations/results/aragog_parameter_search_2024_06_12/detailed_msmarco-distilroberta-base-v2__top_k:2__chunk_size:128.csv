Similarity Measures on the Space of Tasks\nWhat metric should be used on the space of tasks? This\ndepends critically on the meta-task we are considering. As a\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\nbest performance on a new training task. There are several\nnatural metrics that may be considered for this meta-task.\nIn this work, we mainly consider:\nTaxonomic distance For some tasks, there is a natural no-\ntion of semantic similarity, for instance deﬁned by sets of\ncategories organized in a taxonomic hierarchy where each\ntask is classiﬁcation inside a subtree of the hierarchy ( e.g.,\nwe may say that classifying breeds of dogs is closer to clas-siﬁcation of cats than it is to classiﬁcation of species of\nplants).

How does PAL address the execution of complex computations in natural language processing tasks?,"['intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter.
