A “sequence” refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\nasTi∈RH.\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings.

What specific challenges do the tasks in SuperGLUE address in natural language processing?,"['high-level goals, the original version of\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\nMore challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remaining tasks\nwere identiﬁed from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on\ndifﬁculty for current NLP approaches.\nMore diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair\nclassiﬁcation. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution\nand question answering (QA).\nComprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all benchmark\ntasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and\nhuman performance.\nImproved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on\npretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including\nPyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).\nReﬁned usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been\nrevamped to ensure fair ']","The tasks challenge models on various fronts, including deep textual understanding, commonsense reasoning, fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and the ability to handle ambiguity and complexity in language, reflecting a broad spectrum of NLP challenges.","The specific challenges that the tasks in SuperGLUE address in natural language processing include sample-efficient learning, transfer learning, multitask learning, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.",1.0,1.0,0.5485162734985352

In contrast,\nPALuses list manipulations, such as len(objects) , and accesses objects and their associated properties through list\nindexing ( e.g.,object[3][0] ). We found that the LLM is typically conﬁdent in producing these programs. Furthermore,\nwe observed that while COTrequires different expressions for the same concept in different contexts, PALalmost always\nuses the same expression, which is presumably more robust. For example, when there are ﬁve objects, COTpredicts “the\nright-most thing is the ﬁfth item on the list”, and “the right-most thing is the third item on the list” when the number of\nobjects is three. Occasionally, COTalso predicts “the right-most thing is lastitem on the list” which does not provide more\nconcrete information.

How does SuperGLUE's design ensure it presents a more challenging benchmark than its predecessor GLUE for evaluating language understanding models?,"['high-level goals, the original version of\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\nMore challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remaining tasks\nwere identiﬁed from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on\ndifﬁculty for current NLP approaches.\nMore diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair\nclassiﬁcation. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution\nand question answering (QA).\nComprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all benchmark\ntasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and\nhuman performance.\nImproved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on\npretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including\nPyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).\nReﬁned usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been\nrevamped to ensure fair ']","SuperGLUE introduces more challenging tasks retained from GLUE, diversifies task formats beyond sentence- and sentence-pair classification to include coreference resolution and question answering, and features comprehensive human baseline performances to ensure significant headroom for model improvement.","SuperGLUE's design ensures it presents a more challenging benchmark than its predecessor GLUE for evaluating language understanding models by including more challenging tasks, such as retaining the two hardest tasks from GLUE and selecting additional tasks based on difficulty for current NLP approaches. Additionally, SuperGLUE expands task formats beyond sentence- and sentence-pair classification to include coreference resolution and question answering. It also includes comprehensive human baselines to show the gap between strong baseline models and human performance, as well as improved code support with a modular toolkit for pretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP.",1.0,1.0,0.8686888217926025
" In what ways does SuperGLUE expand beyond GLUE's task formats, and why is this expansion significant?","['limitations, we believe that\nWinogender’s inclusion is worthwhile in providing a coarse sense of how social biases evolve with\nmodel performance and for keeping attention on the social ramiﬁcations of NLP models.\n4 Using SuperGLUE\nSoftware Tools To facilitate using SuperGLUE, we release jiant (Wang et al., 2019b),4a modular\nsoftware toolkit, built with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), components from AllenNLP (Gardner\net al., 2017), and the transformers package.5jiant implements our baselines and supports the\nevaluation of custom models and training methods on the benchmark tasks. The toolkit includes\nsupport for existing popular pretrained models such as OpenAI GPT and BERT, as well as support\nfor multistage and multitask learning of the kind seen in the strongest models on GLUE.\nEligibility Any system or method that can produce predictions for the SuperGLUE tasks is eligible\nfor submission to the leaderboard, subject to the data-use and submission frequency policies stated\nimmediately below. There are no restrictions on the type of methods that may be used, and there is\nno requirement that any form of parameter sharing or shared initialization be used across the tasks in\nthe benchmark. To limit overﬁtting to the private test data, users are limited to a maximum of two\nsubmissions per day and six submissions per month.\nData Data for the tasks are available for download through the SuperGLUE site and through a\ndownload script included with the software toolkit. Each task comes with a standardized training set,\ndevelopment set, and unlabeled test set. Submitted systems may use any public or private data when\ndeveloping their systems, with a few exceptions: Systems may only use the SuperGLUE-distributed\nversions of the task datasets, as ']","By including coreference resolution and question answering formats, SuperGLUE expands the scope of evaluated linguistic phenomena, testing models' abilities in more varied contexts and reflecting a broader range of natural language understanding challenges.","SuperGLUE expands beyond GLUE's task formats by introducing more challenging and diverse natural language understanding tasks. This expansion is significant because it pushes the boundaries of model performance, encourages the development of more robust and generalizable NLP models, and provides a more comprehensive evaluation of models' capabilities.",1.0,1.0,0.7720790505409241
