What specific enhancements are recommended for language models to bridge the knowledge application gap identified through comprehensive multitask testing?,"['In the following sections, we will\noutline some of the most pressing challenges that must\nbe addressed in order to facilitate further progress in the\ndevelopment of language models.\na) Emergent Ability: As described in the previous\nwork [87], emergent ability is defined as An ability is\nemergent if it is not present in smaller models but is\npresent in larger models.. From our diagnosis, we suc-\ncessfully identify a few unethical behaviors in ChatGPT\nthat were inadequately discussed in previous works, which\ncould be potentially be viewed as emergent risks. Kaplan\net al. [84] has confirmed that risks inside small language\nmodels can be further expanded in large ones due to\nthe model scales. On the basis of this finding, we add\nthat the model scales and the current trend of prompt-\ning training can exacerbate risks from all dimensions.\nThe main reason is that LLMs could be too feasible\nfrom the learning perspective. Firstly, these models are\nmore context-dependent, meaning that they are easily\nmanipulated by prompt injections. Although we agree\nthat some injected scenarios can be temporarily mitigated\nwith ad-hoc parameter tuning, there is no silver bullet to\navoid all risk concerns brought by prompting. Meanwhile,\nwe urge up-to-date benchmarks for measuring unfore-\nseen behaviors inside large language models. Without\nbenchmarking the emergent abilities, it could be hard to\nmitigate the risks and problems at scale. Secondly, we\nnote that larger language models are generally trained\nwith more data. Assuming the data is completely clean\nand informatively correct, language models will still fail to\nlearnallinformationandknowledge,andalsomaywrongly\ncorrelate information to each other. Furthermore, under\nthescopeofthefoundationmodels,multimodaldatacould\nbring the possibility of miscorrelation between different\nmodalities.\nb) Machine Learning Data: Our discussion lies in the\ncollection and usage of machine learning data.

"How is the student model, DistilBERT, initialized from the teacher model for effective training?","['of models.\nIn supervised learning, a classiﬁcation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\nclasses. But some of these ""near-zero"" probabilities are larger than others and reﬂect, in part, the\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\nthe teacher: Lce=∑\niti∗log(si)where ti(resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\n(resp. the student).

However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy.

Does\nthis mean that machines can perform human\nlevel commonsense inference?\nIn this paper, we show that commonsense in-\nference still proves di ﬃcult for even state-\nof-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag ,\na new challenge dataset. Though its ques-\ntions are trivial for humans ( ą95% accuracy),\nstate-of-the-art models struggle ( ă48%). We\nachieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a\ndata collection paradigm wherein a series of\ndiscriminators iteratively select an adversarial\nset of machine-generated wrong answers. AF\nproves to be surprisingly robust. The key in-\nsight is to scale up the length and complex-\nity of the dataset examples towards a critical\n‘Goldilocks’ zone wherein generated text is\nridiculous to humans, yet often misclassiﬁed\nby state-of-the-art models.\nOur construction of HellaSwag , and its result-\ning di ﬃculty, sheds light on the inner work-\nings of deep pretrained models. More broadly,\nit suggests a new path forward for NLP re-\nsearch, in which benchmarks co-evolve with\nthe evolving state-of-the-art in an adversarial\nway, so as to present ever-harder challenges.\n1 Introduction\nImagine a woman chasing a dog around outside,\ntrying to give it a bath.

This results in examples that are longer and more complex, pushing the generated text to a 'Goldilocks' zone where it is ridiculous to humans but often misclassified by AI models.

How does RoBERTa's use of a byte-level BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) vocabulary contribute to its model architecture and performance?,"['diverse cor-\npora, such as the ones considered in this work.\nRadford et al. (2019 ) introduce a clever imple-\nmentation of BPE that uses bytes instead of uni-\ncode characters as the base subword units. Using\nbytes makes it possible to learn a subword vocab-\nulary of a modest size (50K units) that can still en-\ncode any input text without introducing any “un-\nknown” tokens.\n8Large batch training can improve training efﬁciency even\nwithout large scale parallel hardware through gradient ac-\ncumulation , whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches\nare accumulated locally before each optimization step. Thi s\nfunctionality is supported natively in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).The original BERT implementa-\ntion ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ) uses a character-level\nBPE vocabulary of size 30K, which is learned\nafter preprocessing the input with heuristic tok-\nenization rules. Following Radford et al. (2019 ),\nwe instead consider training BERT with a larger\nbyte-level BPE vocabulary containing 50K sub-\nword units, without any additional preprocessing\nor tokenization of the input. This adds approxi-\nmately 15M and 20M additional parameters for\nBERT BASEand BERT LARGE , respectively.\nEarly experiments revealed only slight dif-\nferences between these encodings, with the\nRadford et al. (2019 ) BPE achieving slightly\nworse end-task performance on some tasks. Nev-\nertheless, we believe the advantages of a univer-\nsal encoding scheme outweighs the minor degre-\ndation in performance and use this encoding in\nthe remainder of our experiments. A more de-\ntailed comparison of these encodings is left to fu-\nture work.\n5 RoBERTa\nIn the previous section we propose modiﬁcations\nto the BERT pretraining procedure that improve\nend-task performance. We now aggregate these\nimprovements and evaluate their combined im-\npact. We call this conﬁguration RoBERTa for\nRobustly optimized BERT approach. Speciﬁ-\ncally, ']","RoBERTa adopts a byte-level BPE vocabulary, allowing for more efficient handling of large and diverse corpora without the need for additional preprocessing or tokenization.

This leads to an improved encoding scheme that is universal and robust, even though it may result in slightly worse end-task performance on some tasks compared to other encodings like character-level BPE.",0.8,1.0,0.8237427473068237

For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error).

For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems.

Instead, in\nTASK 2VEC information on the domain is based on data near\nthe decision boundary (task-weighted domain embedding).\nEncoding useful features for the task: The FIM de-\npends on the curvature of the loss function with the diagonal\nentries capturing the sensitivity of the loss to model param-\neters. Speciﬁcally, in the two-layer model one can see that,\nif a given feature is uncorrelated with y, the correspond-\ning blocks of Fare zero. In contrast, a domain embedding\nbased on feature activations of the probe network (e.g., C1)\nonly reﬂects which features vary over the dataset without\nindication of whether they are relevant to the task.\n3. Similarity Measures on the Space of Tasks\nWhat metric should be used on the space of tasks? This\ndepends critically on the meta-task we are considering. As a\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\nbest performance on a new training task. There are several\nnatural metrics that may be considered for this meta-task.\nIn this work, we mainly consider:\nTaxonomic distance For some tasks, there is a natural no-\ntion of semantic similarity, for instance deﬁned by sets of\ncategories organized in a taxonomic hierarchy where each\ntask is classiﬁcation inside a subtree of the hierarchy ( e.g.,\nwe may say that classifying breeds of dogs is closer to clas-siﬁcation of cats than it is to classiﬁcation of species of\nplants).

How does PAL address the execution of complex computations in natural language processing tasks?,"['work with weaker models, while\nits beneﬁt scales elegantly to stronger models as well.\nDoes P AL work with LMs of natural language? We\nalso experimented with PALusing thetext-davinci\nseries. Figure 8 shows the following interesting re-\nsults: when the base LM’s “code modeling ability” is\nweak (using text-davinci-001 ),COTperforms better\nthan PAL. However, once the LM’s code modeling abil-\nity is sufﬁciently high (using text-davinci-002 and\ntext-davinci-003 ),PALoutperforms COT, and PAL\ntext-davinci-003 performs almost as PALcode-davinci-002 .\nThis shows that PALis not limited to LMs of code, but it\ncan work with LMs that were mainly trained for natural\nlanguage, if they have a sufﬁciently high coding ability.\nIs P AL better because of the Python prompt or because\nof the interpreter? We experimented with generating\nPython code, while requiring the neural LM to “execute” it\nas well, without using an interpreter, following Nye et al.\n(2021); Madaan et al. (2022). We created prompts that are\nsimilar to PAL’s, except that they do include the ﬁnal answer.\nThis resulted in a 23.2 solve rate on GSM 8K, much lower\nthan PAL(72.0), and only 4.5 points higher than DIRECT .\nThese results reinforce our hypothesis that the main beneﬁt\nofPALcomes from the synergy with the interpreter, andnot only from having a better prompt.

In all our experiments, we\nused meaningful variable names in the PALprompts, to ease\nthe model’s grounding of variables to the entities they rep-\nresent.

How does SuperGLUE's design ensure it presents a more challenging benchmark than its predecessor GLUE for evaluating language understanding models?,"['quality of research contributions aimed at the challenges posed by GLUE\nunderline the utility of this style of benchmark for machine learning researchers looking to evaluate\nnew application-agnostic methods on language understanding.\nLimits to current approaches are also apparent via the GLUE suite.
