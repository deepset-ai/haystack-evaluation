These few-shot\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the ']","LLaMA's training data includes a mixture of sources like CommonCrawl, C4, GitHub, Wikipedia, and others, preprocessed with techniques like deduplication, language identification, and quality filtering, emphasizing the use of publicly available data.","LLaMA's training data preprocessing and mixture differ from other large language models in that they are trained exclusively on publicly available datasets, without using proprietary or inaccessible datasets.

How does the accuracy of the largest GPT-3 model compare to human professionals across the 57 tasks?,"['57tasks. On the right are UniﬁedQA\ntransfer accuracies for all of the 57tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy.

What can you say about the calibration of models like GPT-3 in relation to their confidence and accuracy on the multitask test?,"['way, our test shows that GPT-3 has\nmany knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.\nCalibration. We should not trust a model’s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning\nthat its conﬁdence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However,\nlarge neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et al., 2017), especially under distribution shift\n(Ovadia et al., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average conﬁdence\nestimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates\nthat GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its conﬁdence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in\nthe zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and conﬁdence reaching up to 24%\nfor some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error\n(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Kumar et al., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as\nElementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only\nsomewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest\nthat model calibration has wide room for improvement.\n5 D ISCUSSION\nMultimodal Understanding. While text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts\nabout the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as\nimages, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et al., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as\nGPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse\narray of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs,\nbenchmarks should be designed to reﬂect this change.

The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask.

Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”.

This way, the LLM only needs to focus on decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps, while the actual solving is delegated to the interpreter. This synergy between the neural LLM and the symbolic interpreter results in more accurate results on various mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks.",1.0,1.0,0.8035426139831543
