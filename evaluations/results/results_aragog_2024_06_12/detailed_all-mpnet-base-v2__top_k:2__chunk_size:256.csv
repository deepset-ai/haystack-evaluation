Speciﬁcally, we use the bert-large-cased variant.\nFollowing the practice recommended in Devlin et al. (2019), for each task, we use the simplest\npossible architecture on top of BERT. We ﬁne-tune a copy of the pretrained BERT model separately\nfor each task, and leave the development of multi-task learning models to future work. For training,\nwe use the procedure speciﬁed in Devlin et al. (2019): We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with an\ninitial learning rate of 10−5and ﬁne-tune for a maximum of 10 epochs.\nFor classiﬁcation tasks with sentence-pair inputs (BoolQ, CB, RTE, WiC), we concatenate the\nsentences with a [SEP]token, feed the fused input to BERT, and use a logistic regression classiﬁer\nthat sees the representation corresponding to [CLS]. For WiC, we also concatenate the representation\nof the marked word. For COPA, MultiRC, and ReCoRD, for each answer choice, we similarly\nconcatenate the context with that answer choice and feed the resulting sequence into BERT to produce\nan answer representation. For COPA, we ', 'and replacement is performed once in the be-\nginning and saved for the duration of training, al-\nthough in practice, data is duplicated so the mask\nis not always the same for every training sentence\n(see Section 4.1).\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP) NSP is a bi-\nnary classiﬁcation loss for predicting whether two\nsegments follow each other in the original text.\nPositive examples are created by taking consecu-\ntive sentences from the text corpus. Negative ex-\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\nare sampled with equal probability.\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve\nperformance on downstream tasks, such as Natural\nLanguage Inference ( Bowman et al. ,2015 ), which\nrequire reasoning about the relationships between\npairs of sentences.\n2.4 Optimization\nBERT is optimized with Adam ( Kingma and Ba ,\n2015 ) using the following parameters: β1= 0.9,\nβ2= 0.999,ǫ=1e-6 and L2weight de-\ncay of0.01. The learning rate is warmed up\nover the ﬁrst 10,000 steps to a peak value of\n1e-4, and then linearly decayed. BERT trains\nwith a dropout of 0.1 on all layers and at-\ntention weights, and a GELU activation func-\ntion ( Hendrycks and Gimpel ,2016 ). Models are\npretrained for S=1,000,000 updates, with mini-\nbatches containing B=256 sequences of maxi-\nmum length T=512 tokens.\n2.5 Data\nBERT is trained on a combination of B OOK COR-\nPUS (Zhu et al. ,2015 ) plus English W IKIPEDIA ,\nwhich totals 16GB of uncompressed text.3\n3 Experimental Setup\nIn this section, we describe the experimental setup\nfor our replication study of BERT.\n3.1 Implementation\nWe reimplement BERT in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).

How does BERT's architecture facilitate the use of a unified model across diverse NLP tasks?,"['steps in our\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for ', 'ELMo,\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\napproach.\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\nwe do note that there are several other differences\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\nwords).\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\ndings during pre-training.\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\nTasks\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT ']","BERT uses a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder architecture, allowing for minimal task-specific architecture modifications in fine-tuning.","BERT's architecture facilitates the use of a unified model across diverse NLP tasks by having a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder with minimal differences between the pre-trained architecture and the final downstream architecture. This allows for the same pre-trained parameters to be used across different tasks, with separate fine-tuned models for each task initialized with the same pre-trained parameters. By having a unified architecture, BERT can be easily adapted and fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks without significant architectural changes.",1.0,1.0,0.8237531185150146

Data and Model Parallelism in Deep Learning\nThere are two central paradigms for scaling out deep neu-\nral network training to numerous hardware accelerators:\ndata parallelism (Valiant, 1990) where a training minibatch\nis split across multiple workers, and model parallelism in\nwhich the memory usage and computation of a model is\ndistributed across multiple workers. By increasing the mini-\nbatch size proportionally to the number of available work-\ners (i.e. weak scaling ), one observes near linear scaling\nin training data throughput. However, large batch train-\ning introduces complications into the optimization process\nthat can result in reduced accuracy or longer time to conver-\ngence, offsetting the beneﬁt of increased training throughput\n(Keskar et al., 2017). Further research (Goyal et al., 2017;\nYou et al., 2017; 2019) has developed techniques to miti-gate these effects and drive down the training time of large\nneural networks. To scale out training even further, parallel\nwork (Chen et al., 2016) has combined data parallelism with\nactivation checkpointing: recomputing activations in the\nbackward pass without storing them in the forward pass to\nreduce memory requirements.\nHowever, these techniques have one fundamental limitation\nin the ']"," LLaMA incorporates pre-normalization (using RMSNorm), the SwiGLU activation function, and rotary embeddings (RoPE) into its transformer architecture for enhanced training stability and performance.",The modifications LLaMA makes to the transformer architecture for improved performance include rearranging the order of the layer normalization and the residual connections.

As it has been widely realized that it is computationally unaffordable to\nempirically enumerate all possible designs for training 100B-scale LLMs, we present not only the\nsuccessful part for training GLM-130B but also many of the failed options and lessons learned.\nParticularly, the training stability is the decisive factor in the success of training models of such a\nscale.

Furthermore,\nas better-quality data is assumed to train language models\nwith better performances, companies and independent\nresearchers are spending more time on data curation.However, this can not be done easily under the low-\nresource and low-budget scenarios.

Previous\nstudy [96] also show that the computational resource\nrequirements for strong model scaling clearly outpaces\nthat of system hardware. We argue that model scaling\nmay be inevitable, which is determined by the scaling law.\nHowever, recent attempts among model design, tuning\nstrategy and compression could possibly mitigate the\nextreme consumption of the computational ', '(Radford et al., 2019),\n10B-scale language models (Raffel et al., 2020; Shoeybi et al., 2019; Black et al., 2022), to 100B-\nscale GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).

Though fine-tuning has been a de facto way for transfer learning, the evaluation for\nLLMs has been focused on prompting and in-context learning due to their tremendous sizes (Brown\net al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a). Nevertheless, some recent attempts has been on parameter-efficient\nlearning on language models (Houlsby et al., 2019) and prompt tuning (i.e., P-tuning, Li & Liang\n(2021); Liu et al.

Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other.

What specific enhancements are recommended for language models to bridge the knowledge application gap identified through comprehensive multitask testing?,"['In the following sections, we will\noutline some of the most pressing challenges that must\nbe addressed in order to facilitate further progress in the\ndevelopment of language models.\na) Emergent Ability: As described in the previous\nwork [87], emergent ability is defined as An ability is\nemergent if it is not present in smaller models but is\npresent in larger models.. From our diagnosis, we suc-\ncessfully identify a few unethical behaviors in ChatGPT\nthat were inadequately discussed in previous works, which\ncould be potentially be viewed as emergent risks. Kaplan\net al. [84] has confirmed that risks inside small language\nmodels can be further expanded in large ones due to\nthe model scales. On the basis of this finding, we add\nthat the model scales and the current trend of prompt-\ning training can exacerbate risks from all dimensions.\nThe main reason is that LLMs could be too feasible\nfrom the learning perspective. Firstly, these models are\nmore context-dependent, meaning that they are easily\nmanipulated by prompt injections. Although we agree\nthat some injected scenarios can be temporarily mitigated\nwith ad-hoc parameter tuning, there is no silver bullet to\navoid all risk concerns brought by prompting. Meanwhile,\nwe urge up-to-date benchmarks for measuring unfore-\nseen behaviors inside large language models. Without\nbenchmarking the emergent abilities, it could be hard to\nmitigate the risks and problems at scale. Secondly, we\nnote that larger language models are generally trained\nwith more data. Assuming the data is completely clean\nand informatively correct, language models will still fail to\nlearnallinformationandknowledge,andalsomaywrongly\ncorrelate information to each other. Furthermore, under\nthescopeofthefoundationmodels,multimodaldatacould\nbring the possibility of miscorrelation between different\nmodalities.\nb) Machine Learning Data: Our discussion lies in the\ncollection and usage of machine learning data.

"How is the student model, DistilBERT, initialized from the teacher model for effective training?","['of models.\nIn supervised learning, a classiﬁcation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\nclasses. But some of these ""near-zero"" probabilities are larger than others and reﬂect, in part, the\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\nthe teacher: Lce=∑\niti∗log(si)where ti(resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\n(resp. the student). This objective results in a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher\ndistribution. Following Hinton et al. [2015] we used a softmax-temperature :pi=exp(zi/T)∑\njexp(zj/T)\nwhere Tcontrols the smoothness of the output distribution and ziis the model score for the class i.\nThe same temperature Tis applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference,\nTis set to 1 to recover a standard softmax .\nThe ﬁnal training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss Lcewith the supervised\ntraining loss, in our case the masked language modeling lossLmlm [Devlin et al., 2018].

DistilBERT also compares surprisingly well to\nBERT, retaining 97% of the performance with 40% fewer parameters.\n4.1 Downstream task benchmark\nDownstream tasks We further study the performances of DistilBERT on several downstream tasks\nunder efﬁcient inference constraints: a classiﬁcation task (IMDb sentiment classiﬁcation - Maas et al.\n[2011]) and a question answering task (SQuAD v1.1 - Rajpurkar et al. [2016]).\nAs shown in Table 2, DistilBERT is only 0.6% point behind BERT in test accuracy on the IMDb\nbenchmark while being 40% smaller. On SQuAD, DistilBERT is within 3.9 points of the full BERT.\nWe also studied whether we could add another step of distillation during the adaptation phase by\nﬁne-tuning DistilBERT on SQuAD using a BERT model previously ﬁne-tuned on SQuAD as a\n4We use jiant [Wang et al., 2019] to compute the baseline.\n3\x0cTable 4: Ablation study.

Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes.

What characteristic of large language model (LLM) generated text's probability function does DetectGPT exploit for detection?,"['al.,\n2023) may further improve the effectiveness of methods\nsuch as DetectGPT, even as LLMs continue to improve.\nLimitations. One limitation of probability-based methods\nfor zero-shot machine-generated text detection (like Detect-\nGPT) is the white-box assumption that we can evaluate log\nprobabilities of the model(s) in question. For models be-\nhind APIs that do provide probabilities (such as GPT-3),\nevaluating probabilities nonetheless costs money. Another\nassumption of DetectGPT is access to a reasonable pertur-\nbation function.

Finally, DetectGPT is more\ncompute-intensive than other methods for detection, as it\nrequires sampling and scoring the set of perturbations for\neach candidate passage, rather than just the candidate pas-\nsage; a better tuned perturbation function or more efficient\ncurvature approximation may help mitigate these costs.\nFuture Work.

What is the primary goal of introducing the massive multitask test in language understanding models?,"['Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nMEASURING MASSIVE MULTITASK\nLANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING\nDan Hendrycks\nUC BerkeleyCollin Burns\nColumbia UniversitySteven Basart\nUChicagoAndy Zou\nUC Berkeley\nMantas Mazeika\nUIUCDawn Song\nUC BerkeleyJacob Steinhardt\nUC Berkeley\nABSTRACT\nWe propose a new test to measure a text model’s multitask accuracy. The test\ncovers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,\nlaw, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ', 'year, but recent models are already nearing human-level performance on several\nof these, including HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), Physical IQA (Bisk et al., 2019), and CosmosQA\n(Huang et al., 2019). By design, these datasets assess abilities that almost every child has. In contrast,\nwe include harder specialized subjects that people must study to learn.\nSome researchers have suggested that the future of NLP evaluation should focus on Natural Language\nGeneration (NLG) (Zellers et al., 2020), an idea that reaches back to the Turing Test (Turing, 1950).\nHowever, NLG is notoriously difﬁcult to evaluate and lacks a standard metric (Sai et al., 2020).\nConsequently, we instead create a simple-to-evaluate test that measures classiﬁcation accuracy on\nmultiple choice questions.\nWhile several question answering benchmarks exist, they are comparatively limited in scope. Most\neither cover easy topics like grade school subjects for which models can already achieve strong\nperformance (Clark et al., 2018; Khot et al., 2019; Mihaylov et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2019), or\nare focused on linguistic understanding in the form of reading comprehension (Lai et al., 2017;\nRichardson et al., 2013). In contrast, we include a wide range of difﬁcult subjects that go far beyond\nlinguistic understanding.\n3 A M ULTITASK TEST\nWe create a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of\nknowledge. The test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas\nthat are important for some people to learn. There are 57tasks in total, which is also the number\nof Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013), all of which are listed in Appendix B. The questions in\nthe dataset were manually collected by graduate ']","The primary goal is to bridge the gap between the vast knowledge models encounter during pretraining on the internet and the existing measures of success, assessing models across a diverse set of subjects to highlight knowledge and problem-solving ability in more challenging, real-world contexts.",The primary goal of introducing the massive multitask test in language understanding models is to measure a text model's multitask accuracy by evaluating its performance across a wide range of difficult subjects beyond linguistic understanding.,1.0,1.0,0.5017035007476807
"What were the key findings regarding the models' performance on the multitask test, particularly concerning their knowledge application and subject-specific accuracy?","['57tasks. On the right are UniﬁedQA\ntransfer accuracies for all of the 57tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes.

"How does the dynamic masking strategy in RoBERTa differ from BERT's static masking, and what advantage does it offer?","['RoBERTa is trained with dynamic mask-\ning (Section 4.1),FULL -SENTENCES without NSP\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\nAdditionally, we investigate two other impor-\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\narchitecture ( Yang et al. ,2019 ) is pretrained us-\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\nBERT ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ). It is also trained with\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT.\nTo help disentangle the importance of these fac-\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERTa\nfollowing the BERT LARGE architecture ( L= 24 ,\nH= 1024 ,A= 16 , 355M parameters).

Describe the triple loss used in DistilBERT's training and its components.,"['of models.\nIn supervised learning, a classiﬁcation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\nclasses. But some of these ""near-zero"" probabilities are larger than others and reﬂect, in part, the\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\nthe teacher: Lce=∑\niti∗log(si)where ti(resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\n(resp. the student). This objective results in a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher\ndistribution. Following Hinton et al. [2015] we used a softmax-temperature :pi=exp(zi/T)∑\njexp(zj/T)\nwhere Tcontrols the smoothness of the output distribution and ziis the model score for the class i.\nThe same temperature Tis applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference,\nTis set to 1 to recover a standard softmax .\nThe ﬁnal training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss Lcewith the supervised\ntraining loss, in our case the masked language modeling lossLmlm [Devlin et al., 2018].

Optimization of this loss can be performed\neasily using Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes, and in particular using the local reparametrization trick of [18].\nThe prior precision λ2should be picked according to the scale of the weights of each layer.

How does RoBERTa's use of a byte-level BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) vocabulary contribute to its model architecture and performance?,"['diverse cor-\npora, such as the ones considered in this work.\nRadford et al. (2019 ) introduce a clever imple-\nmentation of BPE that uses bytes instead of uni-\ncode characters as the base subword units. Using\nbytes makes it possible to learn a subword vocab-\nulary of a modest size (50K units) that can still en-\ncode any input text without introducing any “un-\nknown” tokens.\n8Large batch training can improve training efﬁciency even\nwithout large scale parallel hardware through gradient ac-\ncumulation , whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches\nare accumulated locally before each optimization step. Thi s\nfunctionality is supported natively in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).The original BERT implementa-\ntion ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ) uses a character-level\nBPE vocabulary of size 30K, which is learned\nafter preprocessing the input with heuristic tok-\nenization rules. Following Radford et al. (2019 ),\nwe instead consider training BERT with a larger\nbyte-level BPE vocabulary containing 50K sub-\nword units, without any additional preprocessing\nor tokenization of the input. This adds approxi-\nmately 15M and 20M additional parameters for\nBERT BASEand BERT LARGE , respectively.\nEarly experiments revealed only slight dif-\nferences between these encodings, with the\nRadford et al.

In-\nstead of full words, BPE relies on subwords units,\nwhich are extracted by performing statistical anal-\nysis of the training corpus.\nBPE vocabulary sizes typically range from\n10K-100K subword units. However, unicode char-\nacters can account for a sizeable portion of this\nvocabulary when modeling large and ']","RoBERTa adopts a byte-level BPE vocabulary, allowing for more efficient handling of large and diverse corpora without the need for additional preprocessing or tokenization. This encoding scheme supports a modest-sized vocabulary that can encode any input text, potentially enhancing the model's linguistic flexibility and performance on various NLP tasks.","RoBERTa's use of a byte-level BPE vocabulary contributes to its model architecture and performance by allowing for a larger vocabulary size of 50K subword units. This larger vocabulary size enables RoBERTa to encode any input text without introducing unknown tokens, resulting in a universal encoding scheme. Although initial experiments showed slightly worse end-task performance compared to character-level BPE, the advantages of a universal encoding scheme were deemed more important, leading to the use of byte-level BPE in RoBERTa's model architecture.",1.0,1.0,0.8052929639816284

The FIM\nof the feature extractor parameters can be written using the\nKronecker product as\nF=Ex,y∼ˆp(x)pw(y|x)[(y−p)2·S⊗xxT]\nwherep=pw(y= 1|x)and the matrix S=wwT⊙zzT⊙\n(1−z)(1−z)Tis an element-wise product of classiﬁer\nweightswand ﬁrst layer feature activations z. It is informa-\ntive to compare this expression to an embedding based only\non the dataset domain statistics, such as the (non-centered)\ncovarianceC0=E[\nxxT]\nof the input data or the covari-\nanceC1=E[\nzzT]\nof the feature activations. One could\ntake such statistics as a representative domain embedding\nsince they only depend on the marginal distribution p(x)in\ncontrast to the FIM task embedding , which depends on the\njoint distribution p(x,y). These simple expressions high-\nlight some important (and more general) properties of the\nFisher embedding we now describe.\nInvariance to the label space: The task embedding does\nnot directly depend on the task labels, but only on the pre-\ndicted distribution pw(y|x)of the trained model. Infor-\nmation about the ground-truth labels yis encoded in the\nweightswwhich are a sufﬁcient statistic of the task [5]. In\nparticular, the task embedding is invariant to permutations\nof the labels y, and has ﬁxed dimension (number of ﬁlters\nof the feature extractor) regardless of the output space (e.g.,\nk-way classiﬁcation with ']","The embedding's norm correlates with task difficulty, while its orientation and distance from other embeddings capture domain characteristics and task similarities.","The Task2Vec's embedding relates to the difficulty and domain characteristics of a task by considering the curvature of the loss function, sensitivity of the loss to model parameters, and the relevance of features to the task. It also captures information near the decision boundary, which is important for encoding useful features for the task. The embedding is task-weighted, meaning it focuses on data points near the decision boundary rather than considering all data points equally, allowing for better performance on new training tasks. Additionally, it is invariant to label permutations and has a fixed dimension regardless of the output space, making it effective for a variety of task types.",1.0,1.0,0.696483850479126
How does Task2Vec differentiate itself from traditional domain embeddings and other task representation methods?,"['embedding (distance from origin) and test error obtained on the task.\nnear the decision boundary since p(1−p)is maximized at\np= 1/2. Compare this to the covariance matrix of the data,\nC0, to which all data points contribute equally. Instead, in\nTASK 2VEC information on the domain is based on data near\nthe decision boundary (task-weighted domain embedding).\nEncoding useful features for the task: The FIM de-\npends on the curvature of the loss function with the diagonal\nentries capturing the sensitivity of the loss to model param-\neters. Speciﬁcally, in the two-layer model one can see that,\nif a given feature is uncorrelated with y, the correspond-\ning blocks of Fare zero. In contrast, a domain embedding\nbased on feature activations of the probe network (e.g., C1)\nonly reﬂects which features vary over the dataset without\nindication of whether they are relevant to the task.\n3. Similarity Measures on the Space of Tasks\nWhat metric should be used on the space of tasks? This\ndepends critically on the meta-task we are considering. As a\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\nbest performance on a new training task. There are several\nnatural metrics that may be considered for this meta-task.\nIn this work, we mainly consider:\nTaxonomic distance For some tasks, there is a natural no-\ntion of semantic similarity, for instance deﬁned by sets of\ncategories organized in a taxonomic hierarchy where each\ntask is classiﬁcation inside a subtree of the hierarchy ( e.g.,\nwe may say that classifying breeds of dogs is closer to clas-siﬁcation of cats than it is to classiﬁcation of species of\nplants). In this setting, ', 'we can deﬁne\nDtax(ta,tb) = min\ni∈Sa,j∈Sbd(i,j),\nwhereSa,Sbare the sets of categories in task ta,tband\nd(i,j)is an ultrametric or graph distance in the taxonomy\ntree. Notice that this is a proper distance, and in particular\nit is symmetric.\nTransfer distance. We deﬁne the transfer (or ﬁne-tuning)\ngain from a task tato a tasktb(which we improperly call\ndistance, but is not necessarily symmetric or positive) as\nthe difference in expected performance between a model\ntrained for task tbfrom a ﬁxed initialization (random or pre-\ntrained), and the performance of a model ﬁne-tuned for task\ntbstarting from a solution of task ta:\nDft(ta→tb) =E[ℓa→b]−E[ℓb]\nE[ℓb],\nwhere the expectations are taken over all trainings with the\nselected architecture, training procedure and network ini-\ntialization,ℓbis the ﬁnal test error obtained by training on\ntaskbfrom the chosen initialization, and ℓa→bis the error\nobtained instead when starting from a solution to task aand\nthen ﬁne-tuning (with the selected procedure) on task tb.\n3.1. Symmetric and asymmetric TASK 2VECmetrics\nBy construction, the Fisher embedding on which\nTASK 2VEC is based captures fundamental information\x0cabout the structure of the task. We may therefore expect\nthat the distance between two embeddings correlate posi-\ntively with natural metrics on the space of tasks. However,\nthere are two problems in using the Euclidean distance be-\ntween embeddings: the parameters of the network have dif-\nferent scales, and the norm of the embedding is affected by\ncomplexity of the task and the number of samples used to\ncompute the embedding.\nSymmetric TASK 2VEC distance To make the distance\ncomputation robust, we propose to use the cosine distance\nbetween normalized embeddings:\ndsym(Fa,Fb) =dcos(Fa\nFa+Fb,Fb\nFa+Fb)\n,\nwheredcosis the cosine distance, FaandFbare the two\ntask embeddings ( i.e., the diagonal of the Fisher Informa-\ntion computed on the same probe network), and ']","Unlike domain embeddings that focus on input data distribution, Task2Vec uniquely represents tasks based on the joint input-output distribution's structure, offering a novel perspective on task similarity and complexity.","Task2Vec differentiates itself from traditional domain embeddings and other task representation methods by utilizing the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to capture information about the structure of the task. Traditional domain embeddings, such as C0, treat all data points equally, while Task2Vec focuses on data points near the decision boundary (task-weighted domain embedding). This allows Task2Vec to encode useful features for the task by capturing the curvature of the loss function and the sensitivity of the loss to model parameters.

How does PAL handle tasks involving large numbers differently than models relying on chain-of-thought methodologies?,"['PALavoids\nthese problems by ofﬂoading the calculation and some of\nthe reasoning to a Python interpreter, which is correct by\nconstruction, given the right program.

Describe the process and tools provided by CodeNet for transforming code samples into machine-learning-friendly formats.,"['related datasets.\nLarge scale. A useful dataset should contain a large number and variety of data samples to expose\nthe realistic and complex landscape of data distributions one meets in practice. CodeNet is the\nlargest dataset in its class - it has approximately 10 times more code samples than GCJ and its C++\nbenchmark is approximately 10 times larger than POJ-104.\nRich annotation. For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems. This information is made available as part of the\ndataset release but it is absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\n5 Construction of CodeNet\n5.1 Collection of Code Samples\nThe CodeNet ', 'large collection of code samples with extensive metadata. It\nalso contains documented tools to transform code samples into intermediate representations and to\naccess the dataset and make tailored selections. Our goal is to provide the community with a large,\nhigh-quality curated dataset that can be used to advance AI techniques for source code.\nCodeNet is derived from the data available on two online judge websites: AIZU [ 8] and AtCoder [ 9].\nOnline judge websites pose programming problems in the form of courses and contests. The dataset\nconsists of submissions to these problems, which are judged by an automated review process for\ncorrectness. Problem descriptions, submission outcomes, and associated metadata are available via\nvarious REST APIs.\nScale and Statistics. CodeNet contains a total of 13,916,868 submissions, divided into 4053\nproblems. Among the submissions, 53.6% (7,460,588) are accepted (compilable and pass the\nprescribed tests), 29.5% are marked with wrong answer, and the remaining rejected due to their\nfailure to meet run time or memory requirements. To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset so\nfar among similar kinds. Submissions are in 55 different languages; 95% of them are coded in C++,\nPython, Java, C, Ruby, and C#. C++ is the most common language, with 8,008,527 submissions (57%\nof the total), of which 4,353,049 are accepted. With the abundance of code samples, users can extract\nlarge benchmark datasets that are customized to their downstream use. See Figure 1 for a summary.\nDiversity. The problems in CodeNet are mainly pedagogical and range from elementary exercises\nto sophisticated problems that require advanced algorithms. The submitters range from beginners\nto experienced coders.

What specific challenges do the tasks in SuperGLUE address in natural language processing?,"['corresponds well to human\njudgments of output quality. Some text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues with\nautomatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).\n4\x0cPublic data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks\ninvolved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create)\na test set with private labels.\nTask format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentiviz-\ning the users of the benchmark to create complex task-speciﬁc model architectures. Still, while GLUE\nis restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand\nthe scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding\nindividual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\nLicense: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research\npurposes.\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the\nNLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according\nto our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 ', 'advances on GLUE, but\nothers remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotone).\nC Human Performance Estimation\nFor collecting data to establish human performance on the SuperGLUE tasks, we follow a two\nstep procedure where we ﬁrst provide some training to the crowd workers before they proceed to\nannotation. For both steps and all tasks, the average pay rate is $23.75/hr.7\nIn the training phase, workers are provided with instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and\nare asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After answering each example,\nworkers are also asked to check their work against the provided ground truth label. After the training\nphase is complete, we provide the qualiﬁcation to work on the annotation phase to all workers\nwho annotated a minimum of ﬁve examples, i.e. completed ﬁve HITs during training and achieved\nperformance at, or above the median performance across all workers during training.\n7This estimate is taken from https://turkerview.com .\n16\x0cIn the annotation phase, workers are provided with the same instructions as the training phase, and\nare linked to the same FAQ page. The instructions for all tasks are provided in Appendix C. For the\nannotation phase we randomly sample 100 examples from the task’s test set, with the exception of\nWSC where we annotate the full test set. For each example, we collect annotations from ﬁve workers\nand take a majority vote to estimate human performance. For additional details, see Appendix C.3.\nC.1 Training Phase Instructions\nIn the training step, we provide workers with brief instructions about the training phase.

However,\nthere are two problems in using the Euclidean distance be-\ntween embeddings: the parameters of the network have dif-\nferent scales, and the norm of the embedding is affected by\ncomplexity of the task and the number of samples used to\ncompute the embedding.\nSymmetric TASK 2VEC distance To make the distance\ncomputation robust, we propose to use the cosine distance\nbetween normalized embeddings:\ndsym(Fa,Fb) =dcos(Fa\nFa+Fb,Fb\nFa+Fb)\n,\nwheredcosis the cosine distance, FaandFbare the two\ntask embeddings ( i.e., the diagonal of the Fisher Informa-\ntion computed on the same probe network), and ', 'embedding (distance from origin) and test error obtained on the task.\nnear the decision boundary since p(1−p)is maximized at\np= 1/2.

Similarity Measures on the Space of Tasks\nWhat metric should be used on the space of tasks? This\ndepends critically on the meta-task we are considering. As a\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\nbest performance on a new training task.

What distinctive strategy does GLM-130B employ to ensure training stability for a 130-billion-parameter model?,"['GLM model of 130 billion parameters after several\nrounds of discussions and exploration, because such a size makes it possible to run the inference on\na single A100 (40G * 8) server.\nOur first attempt at training the model was in January 2022, shortly after we received a small sponsor\nof GPUs for test running. However, we soon realized that we had significantly underestimated the\ntechnical difficulties of pre-training a model at such a scale (>100B). It seems that pre-training a\nhighly accurate 100B-scale model is quite different from training a 10B-scale one. Due to frequent\nrandom hardware failures, model gradients exploding, unexpected excessive memory usage in the\nalgorithm, debug for the 3D pipeline in the new Megatron and DeepSpeed frameworks, inability to\nrecover from optimizer states, blocked TCP responses between processes, and many many unex-\npected “bugs”, the project was delayed for many times. The Tsinghua PACMAN team gave us a\nhand at this difficult time and together we successfully fixed most of the “bugs”.\nBy March, we were still short on computational resources, but fortunately got a chance to try test\nruns on several other platforms, including Ascend 910, Hygon DCU, NVIDIA, and Sunway. The\nimmediate challenge was for us to adapt our training code to these different platforms, as the under-\nlying operators are quite different. Also, it introduced many new issues: the element-wise operators\nnot supporting fast computation for large-dimension vectors, various issues that hindered conver-\ngence—the large gradient norms of input embeddings, native Post-LN, Pre-LN, and Sandwich-LN,\ndataloader state seeds, and computation precision choices in Softmax and Attention — as well as\nnumerous mistakes we ourselves made.

Additionally,\nZhipu.AI also sent a team to help evaluate the pre-trained model and build a demonstration website.\nThe training period spanned two months, during which we began developing a toolkit to allow GLM-\n130B’s inference in low-resource setting with swapping technique and quantization. Though it is\nalready the most accessible model of its scale, together with our partner from Tsinghua NLP, we have\nbeen exploring the limit of popularized hardware platforms, which would truly make the 100B-scale\nmodel accessible to as many people as possible. To date, we managed to reach the INT4 weight\nquantization for GLM-130B. Importantly, the INT4 version of GLM-130B without post training\n16This section is largely extracted and updated from the blog introduction of GLM-130B at http://keg.\ncs.tsinghua.edu.cn/glm-130b/

How does GLM-130B address ethical concerns and biases compared to its counterparts?,"['to agree that they will not use it\nfor any deeds that may be harmful to society and human beings.\nAdditionally, from a technical perspective, we argue that we must also understand LLMs’ toxic\nand biased behaviors and ultimately eliminate them. This aligns with our commitment to “LLM\nInclusivity”, as it is necessary to include more people in the open-sourced LLM research to facilitate\nthe process. Moreover, if an LLM is shown to be good at identifying toxic and biased content,\ntechniques such as self-diagnoses (Schick et al., 2021) can help to reduce the harmful generation\nin a self-consistent post-processing procedure. Therefore, as an initial step, we evaluate GLM-\n130B over a variety of related benchmarks to shed light on the challenging topic. Despite their\nlimitations (Blodgett et al., 2021; Jacobs & Wallach, 2021) which should be addressed in future\nwork, they still serve as a good start to arouse the community’s awareness of the problem.\nA.1 B IASMEASUREMENT : CROW S-P AIRSTable 5: CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) Bias\nMeasurement.

It collects 1508 examples with\nnine different conventional biases and adopts a\nprobing-based approach to compare the pseudo-\nlog-likelihood of a pair of stereotypical and anti-\nstereotypical sentences. Since GLM-130B is\npre-trained with autoregressive blanking infill-\ning, CrowS-Pairs evaluation is directly appli-\ncable. We compare the ', 'decision-\nmaking and information-seeking activities. To prevent\nthis, it is essential to keep the training data current and to\ncontinuously monitor and update the model as new data\nbecomes available, so that the language model provides\nusers with the most accurate and relevant information.\nd) Toxicity: The ethical considerations related to\ntoxicity in the development and deployment of language\nmodels are of utmost importance. Toxicity refers to the\nmodel’s ability to generate or understand harmful or\noffensive content.\nOffensive Language: One form of toxicity that may\narise is the presence of offensive language in the training\x0cdata. This can result in the model generating or under-\nstanding offensive or harmful content when interacting\nwith users [44]. For instance, if a language model is\ntrained on data that includes racist or sexist language,\nit may generate or understand racist or sexist content\nwhen interacting with users. To mitigate this, it is crucial\nto ensure that the training data does not contain any\noffensive or hurtful language, and to actively identify and\nremove any offensive or harmful information that may be\npresent in the data.\nPornography: Another form of toxicity that may arise is\nthe presence of pornographic content in the training data.\nThis can lead to the model generating or understanding\npornographic content when interacting with users [45]. To\nmitigate this, it is crucial to guarantee that the training\ndata is free of pornographic content and to actively\nidentify and remove any pornographic content that may\nbe present in the data. Additionally, it is essential to\nimplement the necessary security measures to prevent\nimproper use of the model.\nIII.

Can PAL's approach be generalized to models trained primarily on natural language rather than code?,"['work with weaker models, while\nits beneﬁt scales elegantly to stronger models as well.\nDoes P AL work with LMs of natural language? We\nalso experimented with PALusing thetext-davinci\nseries. Figure 8 shows the following interesting re-\nsults: when the base LM’s “code modeling ability” is\nweak (using text-davinci-001 ),COTperforms better\nthan PAL.

We experimented with generating\nPython code, while requiring the neural LM to “execute” it\nas well, without using an interpreter, following Nye et al.\n(2021); Madaan et al. (2022). We created prompts that are\nsimilar to PAL’s, except that they do include the ﬁnal answer.\nThis resulted in a 23.2 solve rate on GSM 8K, much lower\nthan PAL(72.0), and only 4.5 points higher than DIRECT .\nThese results reinforce our hypothesis that the main beneﬁt\nofPALcomes from the synergy with the interpreter, andnot only from having a better prompt. Additional details\nare provided in Appendix B. For additional discussion on\nthe advantages of code-prompts over textual-prompts, see\nAppendix G.\nDo variable names matter? In all our experiments, we\nused meaningful variable names in the PALprompts, to ease\nthe model’s grounding of variables to the entities they rep-\nresent. For the Python interpreter, however, variable names\nare meaningless. To measure the importance of meaningful\nvariable names, we experimented with two prompts variants:\n1. P AL−comment – ', 'the PALprompt without intermediate\nNL comments.\n2. P AL−var\n−comment – the PALprompt without intermediate\nNL comments and with variable names substituted\nwith random characters.\nThe results are shown in Figure 9. In COLORED OBJECTED\nandDATE, removing intermediate NL comments but keep-\ning meaningful variable names ( PAL−comment ) – slightly re-\nduces the results compared to the full PALprompt, but it still\nachieves higher accuracy than the baselines COT. Remov-\ning variable names as well ( PAL−var\n−comment ) further decreases\naccuracy, and performs worse than COT.

Many researchers are fascinated by this possibility, encouraged by AI successes in\nother domains and tantalized by the vision of computers programming computers.

Under review.arXiv:2105.12655v2 [cs.SE] 29 Aug 2021\x0cGiven the success of non-AI tools for code, why should we consider AI to augment or possibly\nreplace them? Firstly, AI can help reﬁne and re-tune the heuristics used by traditional coding tools.\nSecondly, based on the training data from past experience, AI can help prioritize when there is more\nthan one sound answer [ 5]. Thirdly, an AI-based tool may handle incomplete or invalid code more\nrobustly, thus expanding its scope. Finally, AI can incorporate signals usually ignored by traditional\ntools for code, such as the natural language in identiﬁers or comments.\nIn the enterprise environment, developers often face code written by large teams over many years\nand geographies. Developers must manipulate such code to modernize it, ﬁx bugs, improve its\nperformance, evolve it when ']"," By providing a comprehensive dataset with diverse programming tasks and solutions, CodeNet accelerates the development of AI models for code generation and understanding.","CodeNet provides a benchmark dataset for code understanding and generation, offering unprecedented research opportunities at the intersection of AI and Software Engineering.

What methodologies were employed in SuperGLUE to establish robust human baseline performances across its tasks?,"['advances on GLUE, but\nothers remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotone).\nC Human Performance Estimation\nFor collecting data to establish human performance on the SuperGLUE tasks, we follow a two\nstep procedure where we ﬁrst provide some training to the crowd workers before they proceed to\nannotation. For both steps and all tasks, the average pay rate is $23.75/hr.7\nIn the training phase, workers are provided with instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and\nare asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After answering each example,\nworkers are also asked to check their work against the provided ground truth label. After the training\nphase is complete, we provide the qualiﬁcation to work on the annotation phase to all workers\nwho annotated a minimum of ﬁve examples, i.e. completed ﬁve HITs during training and achieved\nperformance at, or above the median performance across all workers during training.\n7This estimate is taken from https://turkerview.com .\n16\x0cIn the annotation phase, workers are provided with the same instructions as the training phase, and\nare linked to the same FAQ page. The instructions for all tasks are provided in Appendix C. For the\nannotation phase we randomly sample 100 examples from the task’s test set, with the exception of\nWSC where we annotate the full test set. For each example, we collect annotations from ﬁve workers\nand take a majority vote to estimate human performance. For additional details, see Appendix C.3.\nC.1 Training Phase Instructions\nIn the training step, we provide workers with brief instructions about the training phase.

How does SuperGLUE's design ensure it presents a more challenging benchmark than its predecessor GLUE for evaluating language understanding models?,"['quality of research contributions aimed at the challenges posed by GLUE\nunderline the utility of this style of benchmark for machine learning researchers looking to evaluate\nnew application-agnostic methods on language understanding.\nLimits to current approaches are also apparent via the GLUE suite. Performance on the GLUE\ndiagnostic entailment dataset, at 0.42 R3, falls far below the average human performance of 0.80\nR3reported in the original GLUE publication, with models performing near, or even below, chance\non some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2, Appendix B). While some initially difﬁcult categories\nsaw gains from advances on GLUE (e.g., double negation), others remain hard (restrictivity) or\neven adversarial (disjunction, downward monotonicity). This suggests that even as unsupervised\npretraining produces ever-better statistical summaries of text, it remains difﬁcult to extract many\ndetails crucial to semantics without the right kind of supervision. Much recent work has made similar\nobservations about the limitations of existing pretrained models (Jia and Liang, 2017; Naik et al.,\n2018; McCoy and Linzen, 2019; McCoy et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a,b).\n3\x0cTable 2: Development set examples from the tasks in SuperGLUE.

" In what ways does SuperGLUE expand beyond GLUE's task formats, and why is this expansion significant?","['advances on GLUE, but\nothers remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotone).\nC Human Performance Estimation\nFor collecting data to establish human performance on the SuperGLUE tasks, we follow a two\nstep procedure where we ﬁrst provide some training to the crowd workers before they proceed to\nannotation. For both steps and all tasks, the average pay rate is $23.75/hr.7\nIn the training phase, workers are provided with instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and\nare asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After answering each example,\nworkers are also asked to check their work against the provided ground truth label. After the training\nphase is complete, we provide the qualiﬁcation to work on the annotation phase to all workers\nwho annotated a minimum of ﬁve examples, i.e. completed ﬁve HITs during training and achieved\nperformance at, or above the median performance across all workers during training.\n7This estimate is taken from https://turkerview.com .\n16\x0cIn the annotation phase, workers are provided with the same instructions as the training phase, and\nare linked to the same FAQ page. The instructions for all tasks are provided in Appendix C. For the\nannotation phase we randomly sample 100 examples from the task’s test set, with the exception of\nWSC where we annotate the full test set. For each example, we collect annotations from ﬁve workers\nand take a majority vote to estimate human performance. For additional details, see Appendix C.3.\nC.1 Training Phase Instructions\nIn the training step, we provide workers with brief instructions about the training phase. An example\nof these instructions is given Table 5. These training instructions ', 'corresponds well to human\njudgments of output quality. Some text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues with\nautomatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).\n4\x0cPublic data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks\ninvolved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create)\na test set with private labels.\nTask format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentiviz-\ning the users of the benchmark to create complex task-speciﬁc model architectures. Still, while GLUE\nis restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand\nthe scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding\nindividual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\nLicense: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research\npurposes.\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the\nNLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according\nto our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 ']","By including coreference resolution and question answering formats, SuperGLUE expands the scope of evaluated linguistic phenomena, testing models' abilities in more varied contexts and reflecting a broader range of natural language understanding challenges.","SuperGLUE expands beyond GLUE's task formats by considering tasks with longer inputs, requiring understanding individual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs. This expansion is significant because it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of natural language understanding by incorporating a wider range of linguistic features and relationships.",1.0,1.0,0.8344607353210449
