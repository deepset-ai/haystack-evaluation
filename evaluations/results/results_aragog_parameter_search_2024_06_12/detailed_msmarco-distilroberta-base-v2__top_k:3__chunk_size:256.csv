What are the two main tasks BERT is pre-trained on?,"['BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\nLanguage Understanding\nJacob Devlin Ming-Wei Chang Kenton Lee Kristina Toutanova\nGoogle AI Language\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout }@google.com\nAbstract\nWe introduce a new language representa-\ntion model called BERT , which stands for\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ', 'steps in our\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for ', 'which includes a\ncareful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter\ntuning and training set size. We ﬁnd that BERT\nwas signiﬁcantly undertrained and propose an im-\nproved recipe for training BERT models, which\nwe call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the\nperformance of all of the post-BERT methods.\nOur modiﬁcations are simple, they include: (1)\ntraining the model longer, with bigger batches,\nover more data; (2) removing the next sentence\nprediction objective; (3) training on longer se-\nquences; and (4) dynamically changing the mask-\ning pattern applied to the training data. We also\ncollect a large new dataset (CC-N EWS) of compa-\nrable size to other privately used datasets, to better\ncontrol for training set size effects.\nWhen controlling for training data, our im-\nproved training procedure improves upon the pub-\nlished BERT results on both GLUE and SQuAD.\nWhen trained for longer over additional data, our\nmodel achieves a score of 88.5 on the public\nGLUE leaderboard, matching the 88.4 reported\nbyYang et al.

On the right are UniﬁedQA\ntransfer accuracies for all of the 57tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes.

The subsequent GEMM from the output\nlinear layer (after self attention) is parallelized along its\nrows and takes the output of the parallel attention layer di-\nrectly, without requiring communication between the GPUs.\nThis approach for both the MLP and self attention layer\nfuses groups of two GEMMs, eliminates a synchronization\npoint in between, and results in better scaling. This enables\nus to perform all GEMMs in a simple transformer layer\nusing only two all-reduces in the forward path and two in\nthe backward path (see Figure 4).\nThe transformer language model has an output embedding\nwith the dimension of hidden-size ( H) times vocabulary-\nsize (v).

"How were the questions for the multitask test sourced, and what was the criteria for their inclusion?","['Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nMEASURING MASSIVE MULTITASK\nLANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING\nDan Hendrycks\nUC BerkeleyCollin Burns\nColumbia UniversitySteven Basart\nUChicagoAndy Zou\nUC Berkeley\nMantas Mazeika\nUIUCDawn Song\nUC BerkeleyJacob Steinhardt\nUC Berkeley\nABSTRACT\nWe propose a new test to measure a text model’s multitask accuracy. The test\ncovers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,\nlaw, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ', 'are interested in has\nrelatively few samples. In Fig. 4 we show how the perfor-\nmance of TASK 2VEC varies on a model selection task as the\nnumber of samples varies. At all sample sizes TASK 2VEC is\nclose to the optimum, and improves over selecting a generic\nexpert (ImageNet), both when ﬁne-tuning and when train-\ning only a classiﬁer. We observe that the best choice of ex-\nperts is not affected by the dataset size, and that even with\nfew examples TASK 2VEC is able to ﬁnd the optimal experts.\nChoice of probe network In Table 1 we show that\nDenseNet [15] and ResNet architectures [11] perform sig-\nniﬁcantly better when used as probe networks to compute\ntheTASK 2VEC embedding than a VGG [32] architecture.\n6.

Discussion\nTASK 2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\nTASK 2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\noverhead to the training process.\x0cMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we in-\ntroduce a way of dealing with thousands of tasks, enough to\nenable reconstruct a topology on the task space, and to test\nmeta-learning solutions. The current experiments highlight\nthe usefulness of our methods. Even so, our collection does\nnot capture the full complexity and variety of tasks that one\nmay encounter in real-world situations. Future work should\nfurther test effectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the\nembedding on larger and more diverse collections.\nReferences\n[1] iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 workshop,\nCVPR 2018. https://www.kaggle.com/c/\nimaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018 .\n5\n[2] S.

How does BERT's performance on the GLUE benchmark compare to previous state-of-the-art models?,"['recent work in this area.\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can\nbe improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate\ndata-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and\nBach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task ﬁnetuning and using massive\namounts of weak supervision. Clark et al.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ', ""4: BERT validation accuracy when trained and\nevaluated under several versions of SWAG, with the\nnew dataset HellaSwag as comparison.

While the best known ELMo NLI model\n(ESIM +ELMo; Chen et al., 2017) requires the en-\ntire training set to reach 59%, BERT outperforms\nthis given only 64 examples.

"What unique aspect of the LLaMA training dataset distinguishes it from datasets used by models like GPT-3, Chinchilla, and PaLM?","['tasks have\nbeen dramatically improved using LLMs, as these models\nhave been shown to leverage the vast amounts of knowledge\nthey learn from their pre-training corpora (Roberts et al.,\n2020; Petroni et al., 2019; De Cao et al., 2021). However, it\nremains unclear as to what kind of knowledge LMs actually\ncapture—for example, do they simply learn “easy” facts\nthat frequently appear in their pre-training data?\nWe study this question using closed-book QA evalua-\ntions (Roberts et al., 2020) of LLMs in the few-shot set-\nting (Brown et al., 2020). Models are prompted with in-\ncontext training examples (QA pairs) and a test question\nwithout any relevant background text. The goal of our work\nis to investigate the relationship between an LM’s ability\nto answer a question and the number of times information\nrelevant to that question appears in the pre-training data.\nOur Approach The key challenge is to efficiently iden-\ntify all of the documents that are relevant to a particular\nQA pair in pre-training datasets that are hundreds of giga-\nbytes in size. To tackle this, we begin by identifying the\nsalient entities that are contained in a question and its set\nof ground-truth answer aliases. We then identify relevant\npre-training documents by searching for instances where\nthe salient question entity and the answer entity co-occur.\n2\x0cLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\nFor example, consider the question In what city was the\npoet Dante born? with the valid answers Florence ,City of\nFlorence , and Italy (e.g., Figure 2).

(2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the ']","LLaMA's methodology for ensuring data diversity includes comprehensive filtering criteria to remove low-quality content, language identification to support multilingual capabilities, and a balanced inclusion of various data sources such as Wikipedia, web text, and books, emphasizing the representation of a wide range of topics and languages.",None,1.0,0.0,0.0216057226061821

Discussion\nTASK 2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\nTASK 2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\noverhead to the training process.\x0cMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we in-\ntroduce a way of dealing with thousands of tasks, enough to\nenable reconstruct a topology on the task space, and to test\nmeta-learning solutions. The current experiments highlight\nthe usefulness of our methods. Even so, our collection does\nnot capture the full complexity and variety of tasks that one\nmay encounter in real-world situations. Future work should\nfurther test effectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the\nembedding on larger and more diverse collections.\nReferences\n[1] iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 workshop,\nCVPR 2018. https://www.kaggle.com/c/\nimaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018 .\n5\n[2] S.

They compute pairwise transfer distances be-\ntween pairs of tasks and use the results to compute a di-\nrected hierarchy. Introducing novel tasks requires comput-\ning the pairwise distance with tasks in the library. In con-\ntrast, we focus on a larger library of 1,460 ﬁne-grained clas-\nsiﬁcation tasks both on same and different domains, and\nshow that it is possible to represent tasks in a topological\nspace with a constant-time embedding. The large task col-\nlection and cheap embedding costs allow us to tackle new\nmeta-learning problems.\nFisher kernels Our work takes inspiration from Jaakkola\nand Hausler [16].

This provides a way to utilize\ngenerative models in the context of discriminative learning.\nVariants of the Fisher kernel have found wide use as a repre-\nsentation of images [28, ', 'are interested in has\nrelatively few samples.

What specific enhancements are recommended for language models to bridge the knowledge application gap identified through comprehensive multitask testing?,"['a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\n57subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difﬁculty from\nan elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem\nsolving ability.

Empirical evi-\ndence indicates that larger language models are dramatically\nmore useful for NLP tasks such as article completion, ques-\ntion answering, and natural language inference (Lan et al.,\n2019; Raffel et al., 2019). By ﬁnetuning these pretrained\nlanguage models on downstream natural language tasks,\none can achieve state of the art results as shown in recent\nwork (Devlin et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2018; Howard &\nRuder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; 2017; Ramachandran\net al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019b; Dai et al., 2019; Yang et al.,\n2019; Liu et al., 2019a; Lan et al., 2019).\nAs these models become larger, they exceed the memory\nlimit of modern processors, and require additional memory\nmanagement techniques such as activation checkpointing\n(Chen et al., 2016). Widely used optimization algorithms\nsuch as ADAM require additional memory per parameter to\nstore momentum and other optimizer state, which reduces\nthe size of models that can be effectively trained. Several\napproaches to model parallelism overcome this limit by\npartitioning the model such that the weights and their asso-\nciated optimizer state do not need to reside concurrently on\nthe processor. For example, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) and\nMesh-Tensorﬂow (Shazeer et al., 2018) provide frameworks\nfor model parallelism of different kinds. However, they\nrequire rewriting the model, and rely on custom compilers\nand frameworks that are still under development.\nIn this work, we implement a simple and efﬁcient model\nparallel approach using intra-layer model-parallelism. We\nexploit the inherent structure in transformer based ', 'tasks: feature-based andﬁne-tuning . The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning allpre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).

"How is the student model, DistilBERT, initialized from the teacher model for effective training?","['DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller,\nfaster, cheaper and lighter\nVictor SANH, Lysandre DEBUT, Julien CHAUMOND, Thomas WOLF\nHugging Face\n{victor,lysandre,julien,thomas}@huggingface.co\nAbstract\nAs Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-\nedge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains\nchallenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-\npurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be ﬁne-\ntuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts.\nWhile most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-speciﬁc\nmodels, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show\nthat it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97%\nof its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the\ninductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple\nloss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our\nsmaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its\ncapabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a\ncomparative on-device study.\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released\npretrained language models.The last two years have seen the rise\nof Transfer Learning approaches in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nwith large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels becoming a basic tool in\nmany NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2018,\nRadford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019].\nWhile these models lead to signiﬁ-\ncant improvement, they often have\nseveral hundred million parameters\nand current research1on pre-trained\nmodels indicates that training even\nlarger models still leads to better per-\nformances on downstream tasks.\nThe trend toward bigger models\nraises several concerns. First is the\nenvironmental cost of exponentially ', 'which includes a\ncareful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter\ntuning and training set size. We ﬁnd that BERT\nwas signiﬁcantly undertrained and propose an im-\nproved recipe for training BERT models, which\nwe call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the\nperformance of all of the post-BERT methods.\nOur modiﬁcations are simple, they include: (1)\ntraining the model longer, with bigger batches,\nover more data; (2) removing the next sentence\nprediction objective; (3) training on longer se-\nquences; and (4) dynamically changing the mask-\ning pattern applied to the training data. We also\ncollect a large new dataset (CC-N EWS) of compa-\nrable size to other privately used datasets, to better\ncontrol for training set size effects.\nWhen controlling for training data, our im-\nproved training procedure improves upon the pub-\nlished BERT results on both GLUE and SQuAD.\nWhen trained for longer over additional data, our\nmodel achieves a score of 88.5 on the public\nGLUE leaderboard, matching the 88.4 reported\nbyYang et al.

Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for ']",DistilBERT is initialized from the teacher model by adopting every other layer to maintain some structural and knowledge integrity.,"The student model, DistilBERT, is initialized with the pre-trained parameters of the teacher model, leveraging knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase.",1.0,1.0,0.847854495048523
Explain how BERT uses the 'masked LM' (MLM) for its pre-training.,"['that we only report single-task ﬁne-tuning results\nin this paper. A multitask ﬁne-tuning approach could poten-\ntially push the performance even further. For example, we\ndid observe substantial improvements on RTE from multi-\ntask training with MNLI.\n15https://gluebenchmark.com/faq\x0cjority class.\nC Additional Ablation Studies\nC.1 Effect of Number of Training Steps\nFigure 5 presents MNLI Dev accuracy after ﬁne-\ntuning from a checkpoint that has been pre-trained\nforksteps. This allows us to answer the following\nquestions:\n1. Question: Does BERT really need such\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\nAnswer: Yes, BERT BASE achieves almost\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\n2. Question: Does MLM pre-training converge\nslower than LTR pre-training, since only 15%\nof words are predicted in each batch rather\nthan every word?\nAnswer: The MLM model does converge\nslightly slower than the LTR model. How-\never, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM\nmodel begins to outperform the LTR model\nalmost immediately.\nC.2 Ablation for Different Masking\nProcedures\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a\nmixed strategy for masking the target tokens when\npre-training with the masked language model\n(MLM) objective. The following is an ablation\nstudy to evaluate the effect of different masking\nstrategies.\n200 400 600 800 1,0007678808284\nPre-training Steps (Thousands)MNLI Dev Accuracy\nBERT BASE (Masked LM)\nBERT BASE (Left-to-Right)\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps.

The x-axis is the value of k.Note that the purpose of the masking strategies\nis to reduce the mismatch between pre-training\nand ﬁne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-\npears during the ﬁne-tuning stage. We report the\nDev results for both MNLI and NER. For ', 'scheme, and hyperpa-\nrameters as BERT BASE :\nNo NSP : A bidirectional model which is trained\nusing the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the\n“next sentence prediction” (NSP) task.\nLTR & No NSP : A left-context-only model which\nis trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR)\nLM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since ', 'a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\ntuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\nels are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/bert .\n2 Related Work\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\nLearning widely applicable representations of\nwords has been an active area of research for\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings ']","In MLM, a percentage of input tokens are masked randomly, and the model predicts these masked tokens based on their context.","BERT uses a mixed strategy for masking the target tokens when pre-training with the masked language model (MLM) objective. The purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never appears during the fine-tuning stage.

It is also perhaps surpris-\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al.

By contrast, BERT BASE\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\ntains 340M parameters.\nIt has long been known that increasing the\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\nshown in Table 6.

Conclusion and Future Work\nLarge language models demonstrate impressive few-shot\nlearning capabilities that arise from simply training on large-\nscale internet text. With the open-source release of LLMs—\nand their associated pre-training datasets—the research com-\nmunity can now begin to understand the origins of these\ncapabilities. Our work is one of the first to relate an ob-\nserved phenomenon in LLMs back to the pre-training data\nitself. In our case, our results are negative: while LLMs\nachieve moderate performance on open-domain QA bench-\nmarks, they are mainly successful on questions that probe\nknowledge that appears widely in their pre-training datasets.\nOur work raises numerous directions for further inquiry,\nnamely, how to improve retention of long-tail knowledge\ngiven that simply scaling up model and dataset size will\nlikely be insufficient. We are personally excited about im-\nproving retrieval-augmented LMs, especially with regards\nto their efficiency and retrieval accuracy. Moreover, our\nwork focuses on knowledge learning as it relates to fac-\ntoid question answering, but we leave open the question\nas to whether similar relationships exist for other types of\n8\x0cLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\ntasks, be it knowledge-intensive or otherwise. Relatedly,\neven though our work analyzes the impact of memorization\non question answering, our results may have implications\nfor other tasks that require using (or avoiding) memorized\nknowledge, e.g., analyzing private text, performing com-\nmonsense reasoning, or predicting source code. Finally, we\nhope that future evaluations of few-shot learning can con-\ntinue to shed light into model behavior by tracing accuracy\nback to properties of the pre-training data.

However, it\nremains unclear as to what kind of knowledge LMs actually\ncapture—for example, do they simply learn “easy” facts\nthat frequently appear in their pre-training data?\nWe study this question using closed-book QA evalua-\ntions (Roberts et al., 2020) of LLMs in the few-shot set-\nting (Brown et al., 2020). Models are prompted with in-\ncontext training examples (QA pairs) and a test question\nwithout any relevant background text. The goal of our work\nis to investigate the relationship between an LM’s ability\nto answer a question and the number of times information\nrelevant to that question appears in the pre-training data.\nOur Approach The key challenge is to efficiently iden-\ntify all of the documents that are relevant to a particular\nQA pair in pre-training datasets that are hundreds of giga-\nbytes in size. To tackle this, we begin by identifying the\nsalient entities that are contained in a question and its set\nof ground-truth answer aliases.

Describe the methodology used for evaluating models on the multitask test.

The test\ncovers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,\nlaw, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ', 'One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,”\nconsisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-deﬁned tasks that\nrequire models to interact with ﬂexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\nThe Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask\nNLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have\nacquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This\n7\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nprocess is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the\ndownstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up\nfrom reading the same text.\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how\nhumans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large\nquestion bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk\nabout the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,\nsuch as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum , but there are fewer than 5,000\nmultistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number\nof practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide\na dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be\nused for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set ', 'task,\nand (2) jointly embed the models and tasks, and select a\nmodel using the learned metric (see Section 4). Notice that\n(1) does not use knowledge of the model performance on\nvarious tasks, which makes it more widely applicable but\nrequires we know what task a model was trained for and\nmay ignore the fact that models trained on slightly differ-\nent tasks may still provide an overall better feature extrac-\ntor (for example by over-ﬁtting less to the task they were\ntrained on).\nIn Table 2 we compare the overall results of the various\nproposed metrics on the model selection meta-tasks. On\nboth the iNat+CUB and Mixed meta-tasks, the Asymmetric\nTASK 2VEC model selection is close to the ground-truth op-\ntimal, and signiﬁcantly improves over both chance, and over\nusing an generic ImageNet expert. Notice that our method\nhasO(1)complexity, while searching over a collection of\nNexperts isO(N).\nError distribution In Fig. 3 we show in detail the error\ndistribution of the experts on multiple tasks. It is interesting\nto notice that the classiﬁcation error obtained using most ex-\nperts clusters around some mean value, and little improve-\nment is observed over using a generic expert. On the other\nhand, a few optimal experts can obtain a largely better per-\nformance on the task than a generic expert. This conﬁrms\nthe importance of having access to a large collection of ex-\nperts when solving a new task, especially if few training\ndata are available. But this collection can only be efﬁciently\nexploited if an algorithm is given to efﬁciently ﬁnd one of\nthe few experts for the task, which we propose.\nDependence on task dataset size Finding experts is es-\npecially important when the task we ']","Models were evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings to measure their ability to apply pretraining knowledge without further fine-tuning, a method designed to be more akin to human learning and evaluation processes.","The methodology used for evaluating models on the multitask test involves assessing pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting.

This methodology differs from traditional model evaluations in that it does not require large training sets.

Our\nwork does not assume text is generated with the goal of easy\ndetection; DetectGPT detects text generated from publicly\navailable LLMs using standard LLM sampling strategies.\nThe widespread use of LLMs has led to much other con-\ntemporaneous work on detecting LLM output. Sadasivan\net al. (2023) show that the detection AUROC of the an de-\ntector is upper bounded by a function of the TV distance\nbetween the model and human text.

Mireshghallah et al. (2023) study which proxy\nscoring models produce the most useful log probabilities\nfor detection when the generating model is not known (a\nlarge-scale version of our Figure 6). Surprisingly (but con-\nsistent with our findings), they find that smaller models are\nin fact better proxy models for performing detection with\nperturbation-based methods like DetectGPT.\nThe problem of machine-generated text detection echoes ear-\nlier work on detecting deepfakes, artificial images or videos\ngenerated by deep nets, which ', 'al.,\n2023) may further improve the effectiveness of methods\nsuch as DetectGPT, even as LLMs continue to improve.\nLimitations.

For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes.

These few-shot\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the ', 'fastest to train but the\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\n∗Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llamaperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\nresulting models, called LLaMA , ranges from 7B\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\nmarks, despite being 10 ×smaller. We believe that\nthis model will help democratize the access and\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\n“Social media conversations”).

However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ', 'a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\n57subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more.

The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora\nincluding educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information\nabout a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information\nfrom pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively\nmeasured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used ﬁne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).\nHowever, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 ', 'One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,”\nconsisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-deﬁned tasks that\nrequire models to interact with ﬂexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\nThe Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask\nNLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have\nacquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This\n7\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nprocess is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the\ndownstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up\nfrom reading the same text.\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how\nhumans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large\nquestion bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk\nabout the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,\nsuch as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum , but there are fewer than 5,000\nmultistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number\nof practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide\na dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be\nused for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set ']","The findings highlighted that while recent models like GPT-3 have made progress, they exhibit lopsided performance across different subjects, lack expert-level accuracy, and struggle with procedural knowledge and tasks requiring calculations.","The key findings regarding the models' performance on the multitask test were that while the very largest GPT-3 model improved over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average, it still struggled to reach expert-level accuracy on all 57 tasks.

While our experi-\nments generally focus on zero-shot detection, some works\nhave evaluated the detection performance of supervised\nmethods (typically fine-tuned transformers) for detecting\nmachine-generated text. In this section, we explore several\ndomains to better understand the relative strengths of super-\nvised and zero-shot detectors. The results are presented in\nFigure 4, using 200 samples from each dataset for evalua-\ntion. We find that supervised detectors can provide similar\ndetection performance to DetectGPT on in-distribution data\nlike English news, but perform significantly worse than zero-\nshot methods in the case of English scientific writing and\nfail altogether for German writing. This finding echoes past\nwork showing that language models trained for machine-\ngenerated text detection overfit to their training data (source\nmodel, decoding strategy, topic, language, etc.; Uchendu\net al. (2020); Ippolito et al. (2020); Jawahar et al. (2020)).\nIn contrast, zero-shot methods generalize relatively easily\nto new languages and domains; DetectGPT’s performance\nin particular is mostly unaffected by the change in language\nfrom English to German.\nWhile our experiments have shown that DetectGPT is ef-\nfective on a variety of domains and models, it is natural to\nwonder if it is effective for the largest publicly-available\nLMs. Therefore, we also evaluate multiple zero-shot and su-\npervised methods on two 175B parameter models, OpenAI’s\nGPT-3 and AI21 Labs’ Jurassic-2 Jumbo.

How does DistilBERT's performance on the GLUE benchmark compare to BERT and ELMo?,"['recent work in this area.\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can\nbe improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate\ndata-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and\nBach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task ﬁnetuning and using massive\namounts of weak supervision. Clark et al. (2019b) demonstrate that knowledge distillation (Hinton\net al., 2015; Furlanello et al., 2018) can lead to student networks that outperform their teachers.\nOverall, the quantity and ', '56.0 75.1\nBERT BASE 84.6/83.4 71.2 90.5 93.5 52.1 85.8 88.9 66.4 79.6\nBERT LARGE 86.7/85.9 72.1 92.7 94.9 60.5 86.5 89.3 70.1 82.1\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server ( https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard ).\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples.

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-\npurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be ﬁne-\ntuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts.\nWhile most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-speciﬁc\nmodels, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show\nthat it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97%\nof its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the\ninductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple\nloss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our\nsmaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its\ncapabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a\ncomparative on-device study.\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released\npretrained language models.The last two years have seen the rise\nof Transfer Learning approaches in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nwith large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels becoming a basic tool in\nmany NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2018,\nRadford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019].\nWhile these models lead to signiﬁ-\ncant improvement, they often have\nseveral hundred million parameters\nand current research1on pre-trained\nmodels indicates that training even\nlarger models still leads to better per-\nformances on downstream tasks.\nThe trend toward bigger models\nraises several concerns.

"What modifications to the BERT pretraining process are introduced in RoBERTa, and how do they collectively enhance model performance?","['RoBERTa is trained with dynamic mask-\ning (Section 4.1),FULL -SENTENCES without NSP\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\nAdditionally, we investigate two other impor-\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\narchitecture ( Yang et al. ,2019 ) is pretrained us-\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\nBERT ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ). It is also trained with\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT.\nTo help disentangle the importance of these fac-\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERTa\nfollowing the BERT LARGE architecture ( L= 24 ,\nH= 1024 ,A= 16 , 355M parameters).

We pretrain our model using\n1024 V100 GPUs for approximately one day.\nResults We present our results in Table 4. When\ncontrolling for training data, we observe that\nRoBERTa provides a large improvement over the\noriginally reported BERT LARGE results, reafﬁrming\nthe importance of the design choices we explored\nin Section 4.\nNext, we combine this data with the three ad-\nditional datasets described in Section 3.2. We\ntrain RoBERTa over the combined data with the\nsame number of training steps as before (100K).\nIn total, we pretrain over 160GB of text. We ob-\nserve further improvements in performance across\nall downstream tasks, validating the importance of\ndata size and diversity in pretraining.9\nFinally, we pretrain RoBERTa for signiﬁcantly\nlonger, increasing the number of pretraining steps\nfrom 100K to 300K, and then further to 500K. We\nagain observe signiﬁcant gains in downstream task\nperformance, and the 300K and 500K step mod-\nels outperform XLNet LARGE across most tasks. We\nnote that even our longest-trained model does not\nappear to overﬁt our data and would likely beneﬁt\nfrom additional training.\nIn the rest of the paper, we evaluate our best\nRoBERTa model on the three different bench-\nmarks: GLUE, SQuaD and RACE.

Our goal was to replicate,\nsimplify, and better tune the training of BERT,\nas a reference point for better understanding the\nrelative performance of all of these methods.\x0c7 Conclusion\nWe carefully evaluate a number of design de-\ncisions when pretraining BERT models. We\nﬁnd that performance can be substantially im-\nproved by training the model longer, with bigger\nbatches over more data; removing the next sen-\ntence prediction objective; training on longer se-\nquences; and dynamically changing the masking\npattern applied to the training data.

"What role does the novel dataset CC-NEWS play in RoBERTa's pretraining, and how does it compare to other datasets used?","['transformer model introduced in [ 33]) by pre-training on 10,000 top\nstarred GitHub open source projects written in C, where we use Clang C tokenizer and Sentencepiece\nto tokenize the pre-training data. The C-BERT model is then ﬁne tuned on each classiﬁcation\nbenchmark. Additionally, we experiment with the POJ-104 dataset, which contains code examples in\nC and C++.\nC-BERT achieves appealing results on binary classiﬁcation and vulnerability detection with C source\ncode [ 10,37]. However, it has not been used on multiclass classiﬁcation tasks or with other languages\nsuch as C++, Java, and Python. Because we use sub-word tokenization and different programming\nlanguages share common tokens, we could apply the C-BERT model directly on the benchmarks.\nAfter pretraining, we ﬁne tune the model for ﬁve epochs on each benchmark, with a batch size 32 and\nlearning rate 2e-5. The ﬁne-tuning was done on two V100 GPUs and it took 30 minutes to four hours,\ndepending on the size of the dataset. The sub-word vocabulary size is 5,000. Contexts larger than\n512 tokens were truncated.\nTable 10 summarizes the accuracies C-BERT achives on the four CodeNet benchmarks as well as the\nPOJ-104 dataset. C-BERT achieves high accuracy and performs the best on Java and Python.\nTable 10: C-BERT results (accuracy, in %) for code classiﬁcation.\nPOJ-104 C++1000 C++1400 Java250 Python800\nC-BERT 98.41±0.01 93.79±0.01 91.83±0.06 97.40±0.19 97.09±0.18\nThe relatively low performance on C++ benchmarks is possibly related to the idiosyncrasies of the\ndataset and certain programming practices. Manual inspection suggests that lack of detailed variable\nnames in C++ hurts the performance of the model, in problems appearing similar and having similar\nsolutions. Removing one of the similar problems improves ', 'improves performance on down-\nstream tasks; (3) Our training improvements show\nthat masked language model pretraining, under\nthe right design choices, is competitive with all\nother recently published methods. We release our\nmodel, pretraining and ﬁne-tuning code imple-\nmented in PyTorch ( Paszke et al. ,2017 ).\n2 Background\nIn this section, we give a brief overview of the\nBERT ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ) pretraining approach\nand some of the training choices that we will ex-\namine experimentally in the following section.\n2.1 Setup\nBERT takes as input a concatenation of two\nsegments (sequences of tokens), x1,...,x N\nandy1,...,yM. Segments usually consist of\nmore than one natural sentence. The two seg-\nments are presented as a single input sequence\nto BERT with special tokens delimiting them:\n[CLS],x1,...,x N,[SEP],y1,...,yM,[EOS].\nMandNare constrained such that M+N < T ,\nwhereTis a parameter that controls the maximum\nsequence length during training.\nThe model is ﬁrst pretrained on a large unla-\nbeled text corpus and subsequently ﬁnetuned us-\ning end-task labeled data.\n2.2 Architecture\nBERT uses the now ubiquitous transformer archi-\ntecture ( Vaswani et al. ,2017 ), which we will not\nreview in detail. We use a transformer architecture\nwithLlayers. Each block uses Aself-attention\nheads and hidden dimension H.\n2.3 Training Objectives\nDuring pretraining, BERT uses two objectives:\nmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-\ndiction.\nMasked Language Model (MLM) A random\nsample of the tokens in the input sequence is\nselected and replaced with the special token\n[MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy\nloss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uni-\nformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possi-\nble replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are\nreplaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged,and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vo-\ncabulary token.\nIn the original implementation, random mask-\ning ', 'related datasets.\nLarge scale. A useful dataset should contain a large number and variety of data samples to expose\nthe realistic and complex landscape of data distributions one meets in practice. CodeNet is the\nlargest dataset in its class - it has approximately 10 times more code samples than GCJ and its C++\nbenchmark is approximately 10 times larger than POJ-104.\nRich annotation. For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems. This information is made available as part of the\ndataset release but it is absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\n5 Construction of CodeNet\n5.1 Collection of Code Samples\nThe CodeNet ']","CC-NEWS, a large dataset collected from English news articles, provides a significant source of diverse and recent textual content for RoBERTa's pretraining, complementing other datasets and ensuring a broad coverage of language use and topics.

Negative ex-\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\nare sampled with equal probability.\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve\nperformance on downstream tasks, such as Natural\nLanguage Inference ( Bowman et al. ,2015 ), which\nrequire reasoning about the relationships between\npairs of sentences.\n2.4 Optimization\nBERT is optimized with Adam ( Kingma and Ba ,\n2015 ) using the following parameters: β1= 0.9,\nβ2= 0.999,ǫ=1e-6 and L2weight de-\ncay of0.01. The learning rate is warmed up\nover the ﬁrst 10,000 steps to a peak value of\n1e-4, and then linearly decayed.

We primarily follow the original BERT\n3Yang et al. (2019 ) use the same dataset but report having\nonly 13GB ', 'a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\ntuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\nels are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/bert .\n2 Related Work\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\nLearning widely applicable representations of\nwords has been an active area of research for\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings ', 'token is chosen, we replace\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\nTiwill be used to predict the original token with\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\nrectly captured by language modeling.

We release\nall our models to the research community1.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the ', 'suggests that high-quality language data is\nlikelyexhaustedbefore2026,andlow-qualitylanguageand\nimage data could be run out by 2060. This implies that the\nlimited progress of data collection and construction could\nbe constraints of future LLM development. Furthermore,\nas better-quality data is assumed to train language models\nwith better performances, companies and independent\nresearchers are spending more time on data curation.However, this can not be done easily under the low-\nresource and low-budget scenarios. Even if we pay much\neffort to design comprehensive human annotation frame-\nworks,thedatacouldstillcontaininaccurateormisleading\ninformation due to the natural biases in crowdsourcing.\nIn fact, we notice that prior constructed datasets have\nexperienced multiple rounds of filtering across time [89].\nOn the other hand, current findings suggest that the usage\nof data for language models may not be optimized [90].\nSpecifically, recent works on data deduplication and re-\nduction [91, 92] have shown that data in high quality by\nlow quantity can improve the model performance. Besides,\nwe consider the design of training data as a crucial factor\nto the efficient data usage. For example, experiments show\nthat curriculum learning [93], active learning [94] and\nprompting [95] could improve the data efficiency. However,\nmostofthesestrategiesarestillattheearlystageandneed\nthe further investigation.\nc) Computational Resource: As LLMs are growing\nbigger and bigger, the deployment and training of these\nmodels are getting more and more costly. Daily prac-\ntitioners in NLP and deep learning will find it hard\nto install the LLMs on their own devices. Previous\nstudy [96] also show that the computational resource\nrequirements for strong model scaling clearly outpaces\nthat of system hardware. We argue that model scaling\nmay be inevitable, which is determined by the scaling law.\nHowever, recent attempts among model design, tuning\nstrategy and compression could possibly mitigate the\nextreme consumption of the computational ', 'can improve\nlong-tail knowledge. Our work differs in that we conduct\ncausal re-training experiments and find that model scaling\nis highly beneficial to long-tail QA performance.\n6. Conclusion and Future Work\nLarge language models demonstrate impressive few-shot\nlearning capabilities that arise from simply training on large-\nscale internet text. With the open-source release of LLMs—\nand their associated pre-training datasets—the research com-\nmunity can now begin to understand the origins of these\ncapabilities. Our work is one of the first to relate an ob-\nserved phenomenon in LLMs back to the pre-training data\nitself. In our case, our results are negative: while LLMs\nachieve moderate performance on open-domain QA bench-\nmarks, they are mainly successful on questions that probe\nknowledge that appears widely in their pre-training datasets.\nOur work raises numerous directions for further inquiry,\nnamely, how to improve retention of long-tail knowledge\ngiven that simply scaling up model and dataset size will\nlikely be insufficient. We are personally excited about im-\nproving retrieval-augmented LMs, especially with regards\nto their efficiency and retrieval accuracy. Moreover, our\nwork focuses on knowledge learning as it relates to fac-\ntoid question answering, but we leave open the question\nas to whether similar relationships exist for other types of\n8\x0cLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\ntasks, be it knowledge-intensive or otherwise.

For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes. We ﬁnd that while many of\nthese mistakes were clearly wrong, ', 'we ﬁnd that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost\n70% accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.\nOur results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-of-the-art models still\nstruggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining. The tasks with near-random accuracy\ninclude calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human\nvalues such as law and morality. This second weakness is particularly concerning because it will\nbe important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical.\nWorryingly, we also ﬁnd that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know\nsince its average conﬁdence can be up to 24% off from its actual accuracy. We comprehensively\nevaluate the breadth and depth of a model’s text understanding by covering numerous topics that\nhumans are incentivized to learn. Since our test consists in 57tasks, it can be used to analyze\naggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings. The test and code is\navailable at github.com/hendrycks/test.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nPretraining. The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora\nincluding educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information\nabout a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information\nfrom pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively\nmeasured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used ﬁne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).\nHowever, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 ', 'shows that the largest GPT-3\nmodel has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of\nabout 37.7%. Brown et al. (2020) also observe\nthat larger GPT-3 models perform better, though\nprogress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we\nshow that non-random accuracy on the multitask\ntest emerged with recent large few-shot models\ncompared to datasets that assess commonsense\nand linguistic understanding.\nTo test the usefulness of ﬁne-tuning instead of\nfew-shot learning, we also evaluate UniﬁedQA\nmodels. UniﬁedQA has the advantage of being\nﬁne-tuned on other question answering datasets,\nunlike GPT-3. We assess UniﬁedQA by evalu-\nating its transfer performance without any ad-\nditional ﬁne-tuning. The largest UniﬁedQA\nmodel we test has 11billion parameters, which\nis slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Neverthe-\nless, we show in Table 1 that it attains 48.9%\naccuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite UniﬁedQA have\nan order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also ﬁnd that even the smallest UniﬁedQA variant,\nwith just 60million parameters, has approximately 29.3%accuracy. These results suggest that while\nmodel size is a key component for achieving strong performance, ﬁne-tuning also helps.\nComparing Disciplines. Using our test, we discover that GPT-3 and UniﬁedQA have lopsided\nperformance and several substantial knowledge gaps. Figure 6 shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (few-\nshot) and UniﬁedQA for all 57tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance\nfor all tasks, with GPT-3’s accuracy ranging from 69% for US Foreign Policy to 26% for College\nChemistry. UniﬁedQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of 82.5%.\nOverall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems. Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy\nSTEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects. For GPT-3, 9out of the 10\n6\x0cPublished as a ']","he largest GPT-3 model achieves 43.9% accuracy on average, significantly below the expert-level performance, indicating that even the most advanced models require substantial improvements to reach human professional accuracy levels across these tasks.",None.,0.8571428571428571,1.0,-0.013251298107206821
What can you say about the calibration of models like GPT-3 in relation to their confidence and accuracy on the multitask test?,"['way, our test shows that GPT-3 has\nmany knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.\nCalibration. We should not trust a model’s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning\nthat its conﬁdence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However,\nlarge neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et al., 2017), especially under distribution shift\n(Ovadia et al., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average conﬁdence\nestimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates\nthat GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its conﬁdence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in\nthe zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and conﬁdence reaching up to 24%\nfor some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error\n(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Kumar et al., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as\nElementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only\nsomewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest\nthat model calibration has wide room for improvement.\n5 D ISCUSSION\nMultimodal Understanding. While text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts\nabout the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as\nimages, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et al., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as\nGPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse\narray of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs,\nbenchmarks should be designed to reﬂect this change. ', 'shows that the largest GPT-3\nmodel has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of\nabout 37.7%. Brown et al. (2020) also observe\nthat larger GPT-3 models perform better, though\nprogress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we\nshow that non-random accuracy on the multitask\ntest emerged with recent large few-shot models\ncompared to datasets that assess commonsense\nand linguistic understanding.\nTo test the usefulness of ﬁne-tuning instead of\nfew-shot learning, we also evaluate UniﬁedQA\nmodels.

Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy\nSTEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects. For GPT-3, 9out of the 10\n6\x0cPublished as a ', 'is most suited to the white-box setting. Yet\nwe also observe that if we fix the model used for scoring\nand average across source models whose generations are\ndetected (average within column), there is significant varia-\ntion in AUROC; GPT-2 and GPT-Neo-2.7 seem to be better\n‘scorers’ than GPT-J. These variations in cross-model scor-\ning performance suggest ensembling scoring models may\nbe a useful direction for future research; see Mireshghallah\net al. (2023) for reference.\n5.3.Other factors impacting performance of DetectGPT\nIn this section, we explore how factors such as the size of the\nmask-filling model, the number of perturbations used to es-\ntimate the expectation in Equation 1, or the data distribution\nof the text to be detected impact detection quality.\nSource and mask-filling model scale. Here we study the\nimpact of the size of the source model and mask-filling\nmodel on DetectGPT’s performance; the results are shown\nin Figure 7. In particular, the increased discrimination power\nof DetectGPT for larger mask-filling models supports the\ninterpretation that DetectGPT is estimating the curvature\nof the log probability in a latent semantic space, rather\nthan in raw token embedding space. Larger T5 models\nbetter represent this latent space, where random directions\ncorrespond to meaningful changes in the text.\nNumber of perturbations for DetectGPT. We evaluate the\nperformance of DetectGPT as a function of the number of\nperturbations used to estimate the expectation in Equation 1\non three datasets. The results are presented in Figure 8.\nDetection accuracy continues to improve until 100 pertur-\nbations, where it converges.

What specific architectural changes were made to develop DistilBERT from BERT?,"['DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller,\nfaster, cheaper and lighter\nVictor SANH, Lysandre DEBUT, Julien CHAUMOND, Thomas WOLF\nHugging Face\n{victor,lysandre,julien,thomas}@huggingface.co\nAbstract\nAs Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-\nedge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains\nchallenging.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ', 'by two BiLSTMs.4\nThe results on each of the 9 tasks are showed on Table 1 along with the macro-score (average of\nindividual scores). Among the 9 tasks, DistilBERT is always on par or improving over the ELMo\nbaseline (up to 19 points of accuracy on STS-B).

What core challenge does HellaSwag aim to address in the context of state-of-the-art models' capabilities in commonsense natural language inference (NLI)?,"['seriously\nconsidered. At the deployment stage, we note that LLMs\ncould be attacked to output malicious content or decisions,\nby unethical users [15, 29]. Thus, even internally ethical\nlanguage models can be used unethically by third parties.\nExisting strategies [81, 82] have demonstrated the effec-\ntiveness of preventing LLM abuse, though they can be\ninvalid via attacks [83]. We, therefore, encourage future\nworks to explore more feasible protections for language\nmodels. From the daily usage perspective, the users should\nbe fully aware of the shortcomings of the language model’s\napplication, and not abuse or attack language models\nfor performing unethical tasks. Most of the unethical\nbehaviors towards language models are deemed a great\nchallenge for the LLM producers, as they are almost\nunpredictable. Consequently, we would like to call for the\neducation and policy of model usage in the community.\nSpecifically, courses for proper machine learning model\nusage should be developed for guiding users to learn ‘Dos’\nand Dont’ in AI.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018).

Many recent\npapers have used a basic recipe of ﬁnetuning\nmodels for each end task ( Howard and Ruder ,\n2018 ;Radford et al. ,2018 ), and pretraining\nwith some variant of a masked language model\nobjective. However, newer methods have\nimproved ', 'recent work in this area.\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al.

How should future language model benchmarks be structured to ensure a holistic assessment of models' capabilities and knowledge breadth?,"['a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see\nextensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP\nbenchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are\nat learning and applying knowledge from many domains.\nTo bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the\nexisting measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse\nset of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during\npretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the\nbenchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers\n57subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difﬁculty from\nan elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem\nsolving ability.

From\nthe production perspective, the training data should be\nresponsibly constructed. We emphasize on the privacy of\ndata usage. Without privacy protection, LLMs can easily\nleak private information in generation [18]. One ethical\npractice is to filter the personally identifiable information,\nwhich has been adopted by some recent LLMs [73, 74, 75].\nSecondly, language models for release should be systemat-\nically evaluated on various scenarios and large-scale test\nsamples. We suggest that the benchmarks like HELM\ncould be set as the practice inside the future supply chain\nof language models. However, we also argue that most\ntasks of HELM only measure in the modality of natural\nlanguage, which is insufficient for multimodal LLMs, such\nas audio LLMs [76, 77, 78] and vision LLMs [78, 79, 80].\nDespite the rising benchmarks on multimodal tasks, the\nones for multimodal AI ethics have not yet been ', 'One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,”\nconsisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-deﬁned tasks that\nrequire models to interact with ﬂexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\nThe Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask\nNLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have\nacquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This\n7\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nprocess is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the\ndownstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up\nfrom reading the same text.\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how\nhumans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large\nquestion bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk\nabout the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,\nsuch as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum , but there are fewer than 5,000\nmultistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number\nof practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide\na dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be\nused for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set ']","Future benchmarks should integrate a broader spectrum of subjects and cognitive skills, emphasizing the inclusion of tasks that test models' ethical reasoning, understanding of human values, and ability to perform complex problem-solving, beyond the mere scale of data and parameters.","Future language model benchmarks should be structured to assess models across a diverse set of subjects that humans learn, covering a wide range of topics from STEM, humanities, social sciences, and more.

Instead, it leverages the observation that text sampled from a large language model tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function, using only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model. This makes DetectGPT more discriminative and improves the detection of machine-generated text compared to existing zero-shot methods.",1.0,1.0,0.8164699673652649

This is probably owing to GLM-130B’s bidirectional context attention and MIP,\nwhich has been proved to improve zero-shot results in unseen tasks (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al.,\n2022). As the number of shots increases, GLM-130B’s performance keeps going up, maintaining its\noutperformance over GPT-3 (Cf. Appendix C.5 and Table 14 for details on each model and task).\nLimitations and Discussions. In the experiments above, we observe that GLM-130B’s performance\ngrowth (13.31 to 15.12) with the increase of few-shot samples is not as significant as GPT-3’s (4.35\nto 13.18). Here is our intuitive attempt to understand the phenomenon.\nFirst, the bidirectional nature of GLM-130B could lead to strong zero-shot performance (as is indi-\ncated in zero-shot language modeling), thus getting closer to the few-shot “upper-bound” for models\nof similar scale (i.e., 100B-scale) than unidirectional LLMs. Second, it may be also attributed to a\ndeficit of existing MIP paradigms (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022), which only involve zero-shot\nprediction in the training and will be likely to bias GLM-130B for stronger zero-shot learning but\nrelatively weaker in-context few-shot performance. To correct the bias, a potential solution we came\nup with would be to employ MIP with varied shots of in-context samples rather than only zero-shot\nsamples.\nFinally, despite almost the same GPT architecture as GPT-3, PaLM 540B’s relative growth with few-\nshot in-context learning is substantially more significant than GPT-3’s. We conjecture this further\nacceleration in performance growth is a source of PaLM’s high-quality and diverse private-collected\ntraining corpora.

What findings does RoBERTa reveal about the efficacy of masked language model (MLM) pretraining under its optimized design choices?,"['scheme, and hyperpa-\nrameters as BERT BASE :\nNo NSP : A bidirectional model which is trained\nusing the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the\n“next sentence prediction” (NSP) task.\nLTR & No NSP : A left-context-only model which\nis trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR)\nLM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since ', 'coreference challenges, which people usually construct intentionally\nto test language models’ ability, are seldom seen in the self-supervised corpus that makes up peo-\nple’s daily written texts.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ', 'RoBERTa is trained with dynamic mask-\ning (Section 4.1),FULL -SENTENCES without NSP\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\nAdditionally, we investigate two other impor-\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\narchitecture ( Yang et al. ,2019 ) is pretrained us-\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\nBERT ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ). It is also trained with\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT.\nTo help disentangle the importance of these fac-\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERTa\nfollowing the BERT LARGE architecture ( L= 24 ,\nH= 1024 ,A= 16 , 355M parameters).

Some of the key findings include:

1. Longer training: RoBERTa showed that performance can be substantially improved by training the model for a longer duration. By increasing the number of pretraining steps from 100K to 300K and then further to 500K, RoBERTa observed significant gains in downstream task performance.

2. Larger batches and more data: RoBERTa demonstrated the importance of training with bigger batches over more data. By pretraining over 160GB of text and using large mini-batches, RoBERTa achieved further improvements in performance across all downstream tasks.

3. Removing next sentence prediction (NSP) objective: RoBERTa did not use the NSP loss during training, which contributed to its large improvement over the originally reported BERT LARGE results. This highlighted the importance of reevaluating design choices in pretraining models.

4. Dynamically changing masking patterns: RoBERTa utilized dynamic masking during training, which helped enhance its performance on various NLP tasks. This approach showcased the significance of adaptively changing the masking pattern applied to the training data.

Overall, RoBERTa's findings emphasize the importance of carefully considering design decisions, such as training duration, batch size, data size, and pretraining objectives, in enhancing the performance of pretraining strategies in NLP.",1.0,1.0,0.816030740737915

Given a dataset with ground-truth labels and a\nloss function deﬁned over those labels, we process images\nthrough a “probe network” and compute an embedding\nbased on estimates of the Fisher information matrix asso-\nciated with the probe network parameters. This provides a\nﬁxed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent\nof details such as the number of classes and does not require\nany understanding of the class label semantics. We demon-\nstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task sim-\nilarities that match our intuition about semantic and tax-\nonomic relations between different visual tasks ( e.g., tasks\nbased on classifying different types of plants are similar).\nWe also demonstrate the practical value of this framework\nfor the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor\nfor a new task. We present a simple meta-learning frame-\nwork for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of\npredicting which feature extractors will perform well. Se-\nlecting a feature extractor with task embedding obtains a\nperformance close to the best available feature extractor,\nwhile costing substantially less than exhaustively training\nand evaluating on all available feature extractors.\n1. Introduction\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\nlearn relations between tasks.

As a\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\nbest performance on a new training task. There are several\nnatural metrics that may be considered for this meta-task.\nIn this work, we mainly consider:\nTaxonomic distance For some tasks, there is a natural no-\ntion of semantic similarity, for instance deﬁned by sets of\ncategories organized in a taxonomic hierarchy where each\ntask is classiﬁcation inside a subtree of the hierarchy ( e.g.,\nwe may say that classifying breeds of dogs is closer to clas-siﬁcation of cats than it is to classiﬁcation of species of\nplants).

It is closely related to knowledge acquisition, where the ulti-\nmate target is to structuring the unstructured web contents into knowledge triples (e.g., (London,\ncapital_of, Britain) ). The task can be formulated into either a pipeline framework (a\ncombination of named entity recognition and relation extraction), or end-to-end training.\nIn this work, we adopt three classical joint entity and relation extraction datasets: CoNLL04 (Roth &\nYih, 2004), NYT (Riedel et al., 2010), and ACE2005 (Walker & Consortium, 2005). In GLM-130B,\nwe follow (Wang et al., 2022a) to formulate such challenges into sequence-to-sequence generation,\nwhere our inputs are raw texts and outputs are triples. We only conduct relation-related tasks for\nthese datasets here, and leave the entity-related ones to the named entity recognition section.\n•Relation Extraction : here we extract knowledge triples consisting of “head entity”, “relation”,\nand “tail entity”, given a list of relation candidates. For example, given the input “ In Kunming\nthe 800-some faculty and student established the National Southwestern Associated University. ”,\nthe model output could be (National Southwestern Associated University,\nlocation of formation, Kunming) .\n•Conditional Relation Extraction : given a single relation candidate, judge if the input text con-\ntains the relation. If ', 'does not come with accompanying training data,\nwe train our workers on examples from RTE’s development set. RTE is also a textual entailment\ntask and is the most closely related task in the main benchmark. Providing the crowd workers with\ntraining on RTE enables them to learn label deﬁnitions which should generalize to the diagnostic\ndataset.\nUltraﬁne Entity Typing We cast the task into a binary classiﬁcation problem to make it an easier\ntask for non-expert crowd workers. We work in cooperation with the authors of the dataset (Choi\net al., 2018b) to do this reformulation: We give workers one possible tag for a word or phrase and\nasked them to classify the tag as being applicable or not.\nThe authors used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to expand the set of labels to include synonyms and\nhypernyms from WordNet. They then asked ﬁve annotators to validate these tags. The tags from\nthis validation had high agreement, and were included in the publicly available Ultraﬁne Entity\nTyping dataset,9This constitutes our set of positive examples. The rest of the tags from the validation\nprocedure that are not in the public dataset constitute our negative examples.\n8https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data\n9https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~eunsol/open_entity.html\n17\x0cGAP For the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun Coreference task (GAP, Webster et al., 2018), we\nsimpliﬁed the task by providing noun phrase spans as part of the input, thus reducing the original\nstructure prediction task to a classiﬁcation task.

Discussion\nTASK 2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\nTASK 2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\noverhead to the training process.\x0cMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we in-\ntroduce a way of dealing with thousands of tasks, enough to\nenable reconstruct a topology on the task space, and to test\nmeta-learning solutions. The current experiments highlight\nthe usefulness of our methods. Even so, our collection does\nnot capture the full complexity and variety of tasks that one\nmay encounter in real-world situations. Future work should\nfurther test effectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the\nembedding on larger and more diverse collections.\nReferences\n[1] iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 workshop,\nCVPR 2018. https://www.kaggle.com/c/\nimaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018 .\n5\n[2] S.

What computational approach does PAL use to integrate programmatic reasoning within natural language tasks?,"['PAL: Program-aided Language Models\nLuyu Gao* 1Aman Madaan* 1Shuyan Zhou* 1Uri Alon1Pengfei Liu1 2Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1\nGraham Neubig1 2\n{luyug,amadaan,shuyanzh,ualon,pliu3,yiming,callan,gneubig }@cs.cmu.edu\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (“few-\nshot prompting”). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter.

How does PAL handle tasks involving large numbers differently than models relying on chain-of-thought methodologies?,"['PAL: Program-aided Language Models\nLuyu Gao* 1Aman Madaan* 1Shuyan Zhou* 1Uri Alon1Pengfei Liu1 2Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1\nGraham Neubig1 2\n{luyug,amadaan,shuyanzh,ualon,pliu3,yiming,callan,gneubig }@cs.cmu.edu\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (“few-\nshot prompting”). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter.

Describe the process and tools provided by CodeNet for transforming code samples into machine-learning-friendly formats.,"['requirements change, make it more secure, and/or comply with regu-\nlations. These tasks are challenging, and it is crucial to provide tool support for developers to be\nmore productive at performing them. It is well known that the latest advancements in deep learning\nalgorithms rely on best-of-breed datasets, such as ImageNet, to create increasingly complex and\npowerful models. In this paper, we present ""CodeNet"", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind dataset in scale, diversity,\nand quality, to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code.\nTo promote widespread adoption of CodeNet, we will be launching contests involving use cases based\non the dataset. The ﬁrst contest [ 6] will focus on diversity, inclusion and spurring interest among\naspiring data scientists. We are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization (with\npresence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [ 7] and targeting teams with at least\nﬁfty percent women. We are planning follow-up contests that target experienced AI practitioners.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the CodeNet dataset. Related\ndatasets are discussed in Section 3, and the differentiation of CodeNet with respect to these related\ndatasets is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 describes how CodeNet was curated and Section 6\nenumerates the usability features of CodeNet with several pre-processing tools to transform source\ncodes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models. Section 7\ndiscusses the upcoming CodeNet contest and Section 8 describes important baseline experiments\nwith the CodeNet dataset. Section 9 presents further uses of the CodeNet dataset and Section 10\nconcludes the paper.\n2 The CodeNet Dataset\nThe CodeNet dataset consists of a ', 'readily extract pairs of buggy and ﬁxed code for code repair [ 49,50]. A large number\nof code samples come with inputs so that we can execute the code to extract the CPU run time and\nmemory footprint, which can be used for regression studies and prediction.\nCodeNet may also be used for program translation, given its wealth of programs written in a multitude\nof languages. Translation between two programming languages is born out of a practical need to port\nlegacy codebases to modern languages in order to increase accessibility and lower maintenance costs.\nWith the help of neural networks, machine translation models developed for natural languages [ 51]\nwere adapted to programming languages, producing pivotal success [ 4]. One considerable challenge of\nneural machine translation is that model training depends on large, parallel corpora that are expensive\nto curate [ 52], especially for low-resource languages (e.g., legacy code). Recently, monolingual\napproaches [ 53,4] were developed to mitigate the reliance on parallel data, paving ways to build\nmodels for languages with little translation. Compared with current popular data sets (e.g., [ 4,54]),\nCodeNet covers a much richer set of languages with ample training instances.\n10 Conclusion\nArtiﬁcial intelligence has made great strides in understanding human language. Computer scientists\nhave been fascinated by the possibility and tantalized by the vision of computers (AI) programming\ncomputers. In this paper, we presented ""CodeNet"", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind very large-scale, diverse and\nhigh-quality dataset to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code. This dataset is not\nonly unique in its scale, but also in the diversity of coding tasks it can help benchmark: from code\nsimilarity and classiﬁcation for advances ', 'are\ncontrol ﬂow graphs of all the methods in the program, stitched together to connect call sites with\ntarget methods. Our code graph tool currently supports only Java and Python, but we plan to support\nmore languages such as Javascript.\n7 CodeNet Challenge\nThe launch of CodeNet was well received by the AI community and the media, with coverage\nfrom Forbes[ 29], VentureBeat[ 30], ZDNet[ 31] and others. Within a short span of 3 months, our\ngithub received 1000 stars and has been forked over 119 times. Our vision is to use CodeNet as an\numbrella to curate AI for code datasets for widespread adoption and to drive innovation in AI for\ncode. To leverage the momentum of CodeNet, we will be launching CodeNet challenges to create\nexcitement in the AI community. The ﬁrst contest [ 6] is mainly pedagogical and targets aspiring\ndata scientists. In addition, we are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization\n(with presence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [ 7] to emphasize diversity and\ninclusion (teams must have at least ﬁfty percent women). We will organize workshops to introduce\nthe topic, code similarity, and provide educational materials. This contest will be kicked off in late\nSeptember and the winner will be announced in early December, around the NeurIPS2021 time\nframe. The conclusion of the ﬁrst contest will be followed by a contest that will target experienced AI\npractitioners. Potential contest topics will revolve around practical and compelling use cases such as\ncode language translation, code repair, code performance improvement, and code memory reduction.\n8 Experiments with the CodeNet Dataset\nIn this section, we report the results ']","CodeNet offers pre-processing tools for tokenization, simplified parse tree generation, and code graph formation, easing the transformation of code into representations for machine learning models.","CodeNet provides pre-processing tools to transform source codes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models.

Discussion\nTASK 2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\nTASK 2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\noverhead to the training process.\x0cMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence.

Given a dataset with ground-truth labels and a\nloss function deﬁned over those labels, we process images\nthrough a “probe network” and compute an embedding\nbased on estimates of the Fisher information matrix asso-\nciated with the probe network parameters. This provides a\nﬁxed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent\nof details such as the number of classes and does not require\nany understanding of the class label semantics. We demon-\nstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task sim-\nilarities that match our intuition about semantic and tax-\nonomic relations between different visual tasks ( e.g., tasks\nbased on classifying different types of plants are similar).\nWe also demonstrate the practical value of this framework\nfor the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor\nfor a new task. We present a simple meta-learning frame-\nwork for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of\npredicting which feature extractors will perform well. Se-\nlecting a feature extractor with task embedding obtains a\nperformance close to the best available feature extractor,\nwhile costing substantially less than exhaustively training\nand evaluating on all available feature extractors.\n1. Introduction\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK 2VEC\nembedding, a technique to ', 'task. This can be particu-\nlarly valuable when there is insufﬁcient data to train or ﬁne-\ntune a generic model, and transfer of knowledge is essen-\ntial. TASK 2VEC depends solely on the task, and ignores\ninteractions with the model which may however play an\nimportant role. To address this, we learn a joint task and\nmodel embedding, called MODEL 2VEC, in such a way that\nmodels whose embeddings are close to a task exhibit good\nperfmormance on the task. We use this to select an expert\nfrom a given collection, improving performance relative to\n1arXiv:1902.03545v1 [cs.LG] 10 Feb 2019\x0cTask Embeddings\nDomain EmbeddingsActinopterygii (n)\nAmphibia (n)\nArachnida (n)\nAves (n)\nFungi (n)Insecta (n)\nMammalia (n)\nMollusca (n)\nPlantae (n)\nProtozoa (n)Reptilia (n)\nCategory (m)\nColor (m)\nGender (m)\nMaterial (m)Neckline (m)\nPants (m)\nPattern (m)\nShoes (m)Figure 1: Task embedding across a large library of tasks (best seen magniﬁed).

In what way does Task2Vec's asymmetric distance measure contribute to task similarity assessment and model selection?,"['the division\nis element-wise. This is a symmetric distance which we ex-\npect to capture semantic similarity between two tasks. For\nexample, we show in Fig. 2 that it correlates well with the\ntaxonomical distance between species on iNaturalist.\nOn the other hand, precisely for this reason, this distance\nis ill-suited for tasks such as model selection, where the (in-\ntrinsically asymmetric) transfer distance is more relevant.\nAsymmetric TASK 2VEC distance In a ﬁrst approxima-\ntion, that does not consider either the model or the training\nprocedure used, positive transfer between two tasks depends\nboth on the similarity between two tasks and on the com-\nplexity of the ﬁrst. Indeed, pre-training on a general but\ncomplex task such as ImageNet often yields a better result\nthan ﬁne-tuning from a close dataset of comparable com-\nplexity. In our case, complexity can be measured as the dis-\ntance from the trivial embedding. This suggests the follow-\ning asymmetric score, again improperly called a “distance”\ndespite being asymmetric and possibly negative:\ndasym(ta→tb) =dsym(ta,tb)−αdsym(ta,t0),\nwheret0is the trivial embedding, and αis an hyperparam-\neter. This has the effect of bring more complex models\ncloser. The hyper-parameter αcan be selected based on\nthe meta-task. In our experiments, we found that the best\nvalue ofα(α= 0.15when using a ResNet-34 pretrained\non ImageNet as the probe network) is robust to the choice\nof meta-tasks.\n4.MODEL 2VEC: task/model co-embedding\nBy construction, the TASK 2VEC distance ignores details\nof the model and only relies on the task. If we know what\ntask a model was trained on, we can represent the model by\nthe embedding of that task.

However, it has been real-\nized that it is computationally unaffordable to explore various architectural designs for LLMs. We\nintroduce and explain the unique design choices of GLM-130B.\n2.1 GLM-130B’ SARCHITECTURE\nGLM as Backbone. Most recent 100B-scale LLMs, such as GPT-3, PaLM, OPT, and BLOOM,\nfollow the traditional GPT-style (Radford et al., 2019) architecture of decoder-only autoregressive\nlanguage modeling. In GLM-130B, we instead make an attempt to explore the potential of a bidi-\nrectional GLM—General Language Model (Du et al., 2022)—as its backbone.\nGLM is a transformer-based language model that leverages autoregressive blank infilling as its train-\ning objective.

We examine the underlying mechanism of this\nunique INT4 weight quantization scaling law exhibited in Figure 5 right. We plot the weight value\ndistributions in Figure 5 left, which turns out to directly impact the quantization quality. Specifically,\na wider-distributed linear layer needs to be quantized with larger bins, leading to more precision loss.\nThus the wide-distributed attn-dense andw2matrices explain the INT4 quantization failure for\nGPT-style BLOOM. Conversely, GLMs tend to have much narrower distributions than those of\nsimilar-sized GPTs, and the gap between INT4 and FP16 versions keeps further decreasing as the\nGLM model size scales up (Cf. Figure 15 in Appendix for details).\n5 T HERESULTS\nWe follow the common settings in LLMs such as GPT-3 and PaLM to evaluate GLM-130B for\nEnglish1.

Since GLM-130B has been\ntrained with MIP, here we clarify its scope of zero-shot evaluation. In fact, “zero-shot” seems to\nhave controversial interpretations without a consensus in the community. We follow one of the in-\nfluential related surveys (Xian et al., 2018), which says “At test time, in zero-shot learning setting,\nthe aim is to assign a test image to an unseen class label” where ', 'the patch projection layer. Unfortunately,\nwe cannot freeze the training of the embedding layer in language models.\nFinally, we find the gradient shrink on embedding layers could overcome loss spikes and thus sta-\nbilize GLM-130B’s training. It is first used in the multi-modal transformer CogView (Ding et al.,\n2021). Let αbe the shrinking factor, the strategy can be easily implemented via word _embedding =\nword _embedding ∗α+word _embedding .detach ()∗(1−α). Figure 4 (b) suggests that empirically,\nsetting α= 0.1wipes out most spikes we would have met, with negligible latency.\nIn fact, the final GLM-130B training run only experiences three late-stage loss divergence cases,\nthough it fails numerous times due to hardware failures.

What specific properties of Task2Vec embeddings allow for effective reasoning about task space?,"['on each task.\nA similar approach has been taken in computer vision for\nselecting a detector for a new category out of a large library\nof detectors [26, 40, 38].\n7. Discussion\nTASK 2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\nTASK 2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\noverhead to the training process.\x0cMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we in-\ntroduce a way of dealing with thousands of tasks, enough to\nenable reconstruct a topology on the task space, and to test\nmeta-learning solutions. The current experiments highlight\nthe usefulness of our methods. Even so, our collection does\nnot capture the full complexity and variety of tasks that one\nmay encounter in real-world situations. Future work should\nfurther test effectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the\nembedding on larger and more diverse collections.\nReferences\n[1] iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 workshop,\nCVPR 2018. https://www.kaggle.com/c/\nimaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018 .\n5\n[2] S.

In contrast, a domain embedding\nbased on feature activations of the probe network (e.g., C1)\nonly reﬂects which features vary over the dataset without\nindication of whether they are relevant to the task.\n3. Similarity Measures on the Space of Tasks\nWhat metric should be used on the space of tasks? This\ndepends critically on the meta-task we are considering. As a\nmotivation, we concentrate on the meta-task of selecting the\npre-trained feature extractor from a set in order to obtain the\nbest performance on a new training task. There are several\nnatural metrics that may be considered for this meta-task.\nIn this work, we mainly consider:\nTaxonomic distance For some tasks, there is a natural no-\ntion of semantic similarity, for instance deﬁned by sets of\ncategories organized in a taxonomic hierarchy where each\ntask is classiﬁcation inside a subtree of the hierarchy ( e.g.,\nwe may say that classifying breeds of dogs is closer to clas-siﬁcation of cats than it is to classiﬁcation of species of\nplants). In this setting, ', 'problem size they can tackle: the model must ﬁt\nentirely on one worker. With language models of increasing\nsize and complexity like BERT and GPT-2, neural networks\nhave approached the memory capacity of modern hardware\naccelerators. One solution to this problem is to employ\nparameter sharing to reduce the memory footprint of the\nmodel (Lan et al., 2019), but this limits the overall capacity\nof the model. Our approach is to utilize model parallelism\nto split the model across multiple accelerators. This not\nonly alleviates the memory pressure, but also increases the\namount of parallelism independently of the microbatch size.\nWithin model parallelism, there are two further paradigms:\nlayer-wise pipeline parallelism, and more general distributed\ntensor computation. In pipeline model parallelism, groups\nof operations are performed on one device before the outputs\nare passed to the next device in the pipeline where a differ-\nent group of operations are performed. Some approaches\n(Harlap et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018) use a parameter\nserver (Li et al., 2014) in conjunction with pipeline par-\nallelism. However these suffer from inconsistency issues.\nThe GPipe framework for TensorFlow (Huang et al., 2018)\novercomes this inconsistency issue by using synchronous\ngradient decent. This approach requires additional logic to\nhandle the efﬁcient pipelining of these communication and\ncomputation operations, and suffers from pipeline bubbles\nthat reduce efﬁciency, or changes to the optimizer itself\nwhich impact accuracy.\nDistributed tensor computation is an orthogonal and more\ngeneral approach that partitions a tensor operation across\nmultiple devices to accelerate computation or increase\nmodel size. FlexFlow (Jia et al., 2018), a deep learning\nframework orchestrating such parallel computation, pro-\nvides a method to pick the best parallelization strategy.

What distinctive strategy does GLM-130B employ to ensure training stability for a 130-billion-parameter model?,"['et al., 2022) to leverage its bidirectional at-\ntention advantage and autoregressive blank infilling objective.

Figure 1 left). For zero-shot performance, GLM-130B is better\nthan GPT-3 175B (+5.0%), OPT-175B (+6.5%), and BLOOM-176B (+13.0%) on LAMBADA (Pa-\nperno et al., 2016), and achieves 3 ×better performance than GPT-3 on Big-bench-lite (Srivastava\net al., 2022). For the 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) tasks, it is better than GPT-3 175B\n(+0.9%) and BLOOM-176B (+12.7%). As a bilingual LLM also in Chinese, it offers significantly\nbetter results than ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B (Wang et al., 2021)—the largest Chinese LLM—on 7\nzero-shot CLUE (Xu et al., 2020) datasets (+24.26%) and 5 zero-shot FewCLUE (Xu et al., 2021)\nones (+12.75%). Importantly, as summarized in Figure 1 right, GLM-130B as an open model is\nassociated with significantly less bias and generation toxicity than its 100B-scale counterparts .\nFinally, we design GLM-130B to empower as many people as possible to conduct 100B-scale LLM\nstudies. First, instead of using 175B+ parameters as OPT and BLOOM, the 130B size is decided be-\ncause such a size supports inference on a single A100 (8 ×40G) server. Second, to further lower the\nGPU requirements, we quantize GLM-130B ', 'the patch projection layer. Unfortunately,\nwe cannot freeze the training of the embedding layer in language models.\nFinally, we find the gradient shrink on embedding layers could overcome loss spikes and thus sta-\nbilize GLM-130B’s training. It is first used in the multi-modal transformer CogView (Ding et al.,\n2021). Let αbe the shrinking factor, the strategy can be easily implemented via word _embedding =\nword _embedding ∗α+word _embedding .detach ()∗(1−α). Figure 4 (b) suggests that empirically,\nsetting α= 0.1wipes out most spikes we would have met, with negligible latency.\nIn fact, the final GLM-130B training run only experiences three late-stage loss divergence cases,\nthough it fails numerous times due to hardware failures. For the three unexpected spikes, it turns out\nfurther shrinking the embedding gradient can still help stabilize the GLM-130B training. See the\ntraining notes and Tensorboard logs in our code repository for details.\n4 GLM-130B I NFERENCE ON RTX 2080 T I\nOne of the major goals of GLM-130B is to lower the hardware requirements for accessing 100B-\nscale LLMs without efficiency and effectiveness disadvantages.\nAs mentioned, the model size of 130B is determined for running the full GLM-130B model on a sin-\ngle A100 (40G ×8) server, rather than the high-end A100 (80G ×8) machine required by OPT-175B\nand BLOOM-176B. To accelerate GLM-130B inference, we also leverage FasterTransformer (Ti-\nmonin et al., 2022) to implement GLM-130B in C++. Compared to the PyTorch implementation\nof BLOOM-176B in Huggingface, GLM-130B’s decoding inference is 7-8.4 ×faster on the same\nsingle A100 server. (Cf.

However, it has been real-\nized that it is computationally unaffordable to explore various architectural designs for LLMs. We\nintroduce and explain the unique design choices of GLM-130B.\n2.1 GLM-130B’ SARCHITECTURE\nGLM as Backbone. Most recent 100B-scale LLMs, such as GPT-3, PaLM, OPT, and BLOOM,\nfollow the traditional GPT-style (Radford et al., 2019) architecture of decoder-only autoregressive\nlanguage modeling. In GLM-130B, we instead make an attempt to explore the potential of a bidi-\nrectional GLM—General Language Model (Du et al., 2022)—as its backbone.\nGLM is a transformer-based language model that leverages autoregressive blank infilling as its train-\ning objective. Briefly, for a ', 'prompted datasets from (Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a), listed\nin Appendix C and Table 12. GLM-130B users are suggested to avoid evaluating its zero-shot and\nfew-shot capabilities on these datasets according to the criterion illustrated in Section 5.\n2.3 P LATFORM -AWARE PARALLEL STRATEGIES AND MODEL CONFIGURATIONS\nGLM-130B is trained on a cluster of 96 DGX-A100 GPU (8 ×40G) servers with a 60-day access.\nThe goal is to pass through as many tokens as possible, as a recent study (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\nsuggests that most existing LLMs are largely under-trained.\nThe 3D Parallel Strategy. The data parallelism (Valiant, 1990) and tensor model paral-\nlelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019) are the de facto practices for training billion-scale models (Wang &\nKomatsuzaki, 2021; Du et al., 2022). To further handle the huge GPU memory requirement and the\ndecrease in overall GPU utilization resulted from applying tensor parallel between nodes—as 40G\nrather than 80G A100s are used for training GLM-130B, we combine the pipeline model parallelism\nwith the other two strategies to form a 3D parallel strategy.\nThe pipeline parallelism divides the model into sequential stages for each parallel group, and to fur-\nther minimize bubbles introduced by pipeline, we leverage the PipeDream-Flush (Narayanan et al.,\n2021) implementation from DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) to train GLM-130B with a relative\n4\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nbig global batch size (4,224) to reduce time and GPU memory wasting.

"What specific tasks and benchmarks were used to evaluate PAL's performance, and what were the results?","['PAL: Program-aided Language Models\nLuyu Gao* 1Aman Madaan* 1Shuyan Zhou* 1Uri Alon1Pengfei Liu1 2Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1\nGraham Neubig1 2\n{luyug,amadaan,shuyanzh,ualon,pliu3,yiming,callan,gneubig }@cs.cmu.edu\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (“few-\nshot prompting”). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter.

How does the inclusion of specific metadata in CodeNet facilitate a wide range of code analysis tasks?,"['related datasets.\nLarge scale.

For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems.

Let αbe the shrinking factor, the strategy can be easily implemented via word _embedding =\nword _embedding ∗α+word _embedding .detach ()∗(1−α). Figure 4 (b) suggests that empirically,\nsetting α= 0.1wipes out most spikes we would have met, with negligible latency.\nIn fact, the final GLM-130B training run only experiences three late-stage loss divergence cases,\nthough it fails numerous times due to hardware failures.

Table 1 summarizes the comparison\nbetween GLM-130B, GPT-3 and another two open-source efforts—OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B,\nas well as PaLM 540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)—a 4 ×larger model—as a reference.\nAltogether, the conceptual uniqueness and engineering efforts enable GLM-130B to exhibit perfor-\nmance that surpasses the level of GPT-3 on a wide range of benchmarks (in total 112 tasks) and also\noutperforms PaLM 540B in many cases, while outperformance over GPT-3 has not been observed in\nOPT-175B and BLOOM-176B (Cf. Figure 1 left). For zero-shot performance, GLM-130B is better\nthan GPT-3 175B (+5.0%), OPT-175B (+6.5%), and BLOOM-176B (+13.0%) on LAMBADA (Pa-\nperno et al., 2016), and achieves 3 ×better performance than GPT-3 on Big-bench-lite (Srivastava\net al., 2022). For the 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) tasks, it is better than GPT-3 175B\n(+0.9%) and BLOOM-176B (+12.7%). As a bilingual LLM also in Chinese, it offers significantly\nbetter results than ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B (Wang et al., 2021)—the largest Chinese LLM—on 7\nzero-shot CLUE (Xu et al., 2020) datasets (+24.26%) and 5 zero-shot FewCLUE (Xu et al., 2021)\nones (+12.75%). Importantly, as summarized in Figure 1 right, GLM-130B as an open model is\nassociated with significantly less bias and generation toxicity than its 100B-scale counterparts .\nFinally, we design GLM-130B to empower as many people as possible to conduct 100B-scale LLM\nstudies. First, instead of using 175B+ parameters as OPT and BLOOM, the 130B size is decided be-\ncause such a size supports inference on a single A100 (8 ×40G) server. Second, to further lower the\nGPU requirements, we quantize GLM-130B ', 'into INT4 precision without post training while OPT\nand BLOOM can only reach INT8. Due to a unique property of the GLM architecture, GLM-130B’s\nINT4 quantization introduces negligible performance degradation, e.g., -0.74% on LAMBADA and\neven +0.05% on MMLU, making it still better than the uncompressed GPT-3. This enables GLM-\n130B’s fast inference with performance guarantee on a server of 4 ×RTX 3090 (24G) or 8 ×RTX\n2080 Ti (11G), the most affordable GPU required for using 100B-scale LLMs to date.\n2\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nGradient Norm(a) More than 30 failed preliminary trials at 100B-scale (b) Final decisive trials: Sandwich-LN v.s.

Can PAL's approach be generalized to models trained primarily on natural language rather than code?,"['PAL: Program-aided Language Models\nLuyu Gao* 1Aman Madaan* 1Shuyan Zhou* 1Uri Alon1Pengfei Liu1 2Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1\nGraham Neubig1 2\n{luyug,amadaan,shuyanzh,ualon,pliu3,yiming,callan,gneubig }@cs.cmu.edu\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (“few-\nshot prompting”). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a\nneural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13\nmathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reason-\ning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other bench-\nmarks. In all these natural language reasoning\ntasks, generating code using an LLM and rea-\nsoning using a Python interpreter leads to more\naccurate results than much larger models.

The GLUE benchmark, introduced a little over one year ago, offers\na single-number metric that summarizes progress on a diverse set of such tasks,\nbut performance on the benchmark has recently surpassed the level of non-expert\nhumans, suggesting limited headroom for further research. In this paper we present\nSuperGLUE, a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difﬁ-\ncult language understanding tasks, a software toolkit, and a public leaderboard.\nSuperGLUE is available at super.gluebenchmark.com .\n1 Introduction\nRecently there has been notable progress across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, led\nby methods such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2019). The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is\na collection of nine language understanding tasks built on existing public datasets, together with\nprivate test data, an evaluation server, a single-number ', 'limitations, we believe that\nWinogender’s inclusion is worthwhile in providing a coarse sense of how social biases evolve with\nmodel performance and for keeping attention on the social ramiﬁcations of NLP models.\n4 Using SuperGLUE\nSoftware Tools To facilitate using SuperGLUE, we release jiant (Wang et al., 2019b),4a modular\nsoftware toolkit, built with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), components from AllenNLP (Gardner\net al., 2017), and the transformers package.5jiant implements our baselines and supports the\nevaluation of custom models and training methods on the benchmark tasks. The toolkit includes\nsupport for existing popular pretrained models such as OpenAI GPT and BERT, as well as support\nfor multistage and multitask learning of the kind seen in the strongest models on GLUE.\nEligibility Any system or method that can produce predictions for the SuperGLUE tasks is eligible\nfor submission to the leaderboard, subject to the data-use and submission frequency policies stated\nimmediately below. There are no restrictions on the type of methods that may be used, and there is\nno requirement that any form of parameter sharing or shared initialization be used across the tasks in\nthe benchmark. To limit overﬁtting to the private test data, users are limited to a maximum of two\nsubmissions per day and six submissions per month.\nData Data for the tasks are available for download through the SuperGLUE site and through a\ndownload script included with the software toolkit.

Table 1 summarizes the comparison\nbetween GLM-130B, GPT-3 and another two open-source efforts—OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B,\nas well as PaLM 540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)—a 4 ×larger model—as a reference.\nAltogether, the conceptual uniqueness and engineering efforts enable GLM-130B to exhibit perfor-\nmance that surpasses the level of GPT-3 on a wide range of benchmarks (in total 112 tasks) and also\noutperforms PaLM 540B in many cases, while outperformance over GPT-3 has not been observed in\nOPT-175B and BLOOM-176B (Cf. Figure 1 left). For zero-shot performance, GLM-130B is better\nthan GPT-3 175B (+5.0%), OPT-175B (+6.5%), and BLOOM-176B (+13.0%) on LAMBADA (Pa-\nperno et al., 2016), and achieves 3 ×better performance than GPT-3 on Big-bench-lite (Srivastava\net al., 2022). For the 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) tasks, it is better than GPT-3 175B\n(+0.9%) and BLOOM-176B (+12.7%). As a bilingual LLM also in Chinese, it offers significantly\nbetter results than ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B (Wang et al., 2021)—the largest Chinese LLM—on 7\nzero-shot CLUE (Xu et al., 2020) datasets (+24.26%) and 5 zero-shot FewCLUE (Xu et al., 2021)\nones (+12.75%). Importantly, as summarized in Figure 1 right, GLM-130B as an open model is\nassociated with significantly less bias and generation toxicity than its 100B-scale counterparts .\nFinally, we design GLM-130B to empower as many people as possible to conduct 100B-scale LLM\nstudies. First, instead of using 175B+ parameters as OPT and BLOOM, the 130B size is decided be-\ncause such a size supports inference on a single A100 (8 ×40G) server. Second, to further lower the\nGPU requirements, we quantize GLM-130B ', 'et al., 2019; Fan\net al., 2019). Very recent work (Dettmers et al., 2022) shows that LLMs such as OPT-175B and\nBLOOM-176B can be quantized to 8 bit due to special distribution of outlier dimensions. In this\nwork, we demonstrate GLM’s scaling law for INT4 weight quantization, which allows GLM-130B\nto inference on as few as 4 ×RTX 3090 (24G) GPUs or 8 ×RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs.\n7 C ONCLUSION AND LESSONS\nWe introduce GLM-130B, a bilingual pre-trained language model that aims to facilitate open and\ninclusive LLM research.

Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter.

How does CodeNet's dataset size and diversity support advanced AI for code research compared to previous datasets?,"['requirements change, make it more secure, and/or comply with regu-\nlations. These tasks are challenging, and it is crucial to provide tool support for developers to be\nmore productive at performing them. It is well known that the latest advancements in deep learning\nalgorithms rely on best-of-breed datasets, such as ImageNet, to create increasingly complex and\npowerful models. In this paper, we present ""CodeNet"", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind dataset in scale, diversity,\nand quality, to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code.\nTo promote widespread adoption of CodeNet, we will be launching contests involving use cases based\non the dataset. The ﬁrst contest [ 6] will focus on diversity, inclusion and spurring interest among\naspiring data scientists. We are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization (with\npresence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [ 7] and targeting teams with at least\nﬁfty percent women. We are planning follow-up contests that target experienced AI practitioners.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the CodeNet dataset. Related\ndatasets are discussed in Section 3, and the differentiation of CodeNet with respect to these related\ndatasets is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 describes how CodeNet was curated and Section 6\nenumerates the usability features of CodeNet with several pre-processing tools to transform source\ncodes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models. Section 7\ndiscusses the upcoming CodeNet contest and Section 8 describes important baseline experiments\nwith the CodeNet dataset. Section 9 presents further uses of the CodeNet dataset and Section 10\nconcludes the paper.\n2 The CodeNet Dataset\nThe CodeNet dataset consists of a ', 'related datasets.\nLarge scale. A useful dataset should contain a large number and variety of data samples to expose\nthe realistic and complex landscape of data distributions one meets in practice. CodeNet is the\nlargest dataset in its class - it has approximately 10 times more code samples than GCJ and its C++\nbenchmark is approximately 10 times larger than POJ-104.\nRich annotation. For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems. This information is made available as part of the\ndataset release but it is absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\n5 Construction of CodeNet\n5.1 Collection of Code Samples\nThe CodeNet ', 'CodeNet: A Large-Scale AI for Code Dataset for\nLearning a Diversity of Coding Tasks\nRuchir Puri1, David S.

In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset CodeNet ,\nconsisting of over 14 million code samples and about 500 million lines of code\nin 55 different programming languages, which is aimed at teaching AI to code.\nIn addition to its large scale, CodeNet has a rich set of high-quality annotations\nto benchmark and help accelerate research in AI techniques for a variety of crit-\nical coding tasks, including code similarity and classiﬁcation, code translation\nbetween a large variety of programming languages, and code performance (runtime\nand memory) improvement techniques. Additionally, CodeNet provides sample\ninput and output test sets for 98.5% of the code samples, which can be used as\nan oracle for determining code correctness and potentially guide reinforcement\nlearning for code quality improvements.
