What are the two main tasks BERT is pre-trained on?,"['steps in our\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for ', 'is a\nlarge-scale reading comprehension dataset with\nmore than 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000\nquestions. The dataset is collected from English\nexaminations in China, which are designed for\nmiddle and high school students. In RACE, each\npassage is associated with multiple questions. For\nevery question, the task is to select one correct an-\nswer from four options. RACE has signiﬁcantly\nlonger context than other popular reading compre-\nhension datasets and the proportion of questions\nthat requires reasoning is very large.\n4 Training Procedure Analysis\nThis section explores and quantiﬁes which choices\nare important for successfully pretraining BERT\nmodels. We keep the model architecture ﬁxed.7\nSpeciﬁcally, we begin by training BERT models\nwith the same conﬁguration as BERT BASE (L=\n12,H= 768 ,A= 12 , 110M params).\n4.1 Static vs. Dynamic Masking\nAs discussed in Section 2, BERT relies on ran-\ndomly masking and predicting tokens. The orig-\ninal BERT implementation performed masking\nonce during data preprocessing, resulting in a sin-\nglestatic mask. To avoid using the same mask for\neach training instance in every epoch, training data\nwas duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is\nmasked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of\ntraining. Thus, each training sequence was seen\nwith the same mask four times during training.\nWe compare this strategy with dynamic mask-\ningwhere we generate the masking pattern every\ntime we feed a sequence to the model. This be-\ncomes crucial when pretraining for more steps or\nwith larger datasets.\n7Studying architectural changes, including larger archi-\ntectures, is an important area for future work.Masking SQuAD 2.0 MNLI-m SST-2\nreference 76.3 84.3 92.8\nOur reimplementation:\nstatic 78.3 84.3 92.5\ndynamic 78.7 84.0 92.9\nTable 1: Comparison between static and dynamic\nmasking for BERT BASE.

How does BERT's architecture facilitate the use of a unified model across diverse NLP tasks?,"['the H= 768 and 4096 for the H= 1024 .\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\x0cInput/Output Representations To make BERT\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\n(e.g.,⟨Question, Answer⟩) in one token sequence.\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\nasTi∈RH.\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\nvised tasks, described in this section.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ']","BERT uses a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder architecture, allowing for minimal task-specific architecture modifications in fine-tuning.","BERT's architecture facilitates the use of a unified model across diverse NLP tasks by pre-training deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text, conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.

We also showed that for\nBERT models, careful attention to the placement of layer\nnormalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving\nincreased accuracies as the model size increases.

As shown\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can\nbe improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate\ndata-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and\nBach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task ﬁnetuning and using massive\namounts of weak supervision. Clark et al.

Bi-directional Transformer Results Using BERT\nIn this section, we apply our methodology to BERT-style\ntransformer models and study the effect of model scaling\non several downstream tasks. Prior work (Lan et al., 2019)\nfound that increasing model size beyond BERT-large with\n336M parameters results in unexpected model degradation.\nTo address this degradation, the authors of that work (Lan\net al., 2019) introduced parameter sharing and showed that\nthat their models scale much better compared to the original\nBERT model.\nWe further investigated this behaviour and empirically\ndemonstrated that rearranging the order of the layer nor-\nmalization and the residual connections as shown in Figure\n7 is critical to enable the scaling of the BERT-style mod-\nels beyond BERT-Large.

As LLMs, such as GPT-3, become more advanced and capable of generating text that is increasingly indistinguishable from human writing, there is a growing concern about the potential misuse of these technologies. 

DetectGPT's approach of using probability curvature to compare the log probabilities of original samples with perturbed samples generated by a surrogate model provides a promising solution to this problem. By analyzing the differences in log probabilities, DetectGPT can identify signals that are difficult for humans to recognize, thus giving teachers, news-readers, and other users more confidence in the authenticity of the text they consume.

Moreover, DetectGPT's findings suggest that using the same model to score samples as the one that generated them yields the best detection performance. This highlights the importance of understanding the source model and its characteristics in detecting machine-generated text accurately. 

Overall, DetectGPT's approach contributes to addressing the potential misuse of LLMs by providing a reliable method for detecting machine-generated text, thus helping to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of content in various contexts, such as student assessment, journalism, and news reporting.",1.0,1.0,0.5489884614944458

For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes. We ﬁnd that while many of\nthese mistakes were clearly wrong, ']","Models were evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings to measure their ability to apply pretraining knowledge without further fine-tuning, a method designed to be more akin to human learning and evaluation processes.","The methodology used for evaluating models on the multitask test involves testing models on 57 different tasks covering various subjects such as mathematics, history, computer science, and law. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem-solving ability. The evaluation is comprehensive, assessing the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding across multiple tasks. This approach differs from traditional model evaluations by requiring models to perform well on a wide range of tasks that span different domains, rather than focusing on a single specific benchmark or task. Additionally, the multitask test aims to identify important shortcomings in models, including lopsided performance, lack of awareness of when they are wrong, and near-random accuracy on socially important subjects like morality and law.",1.0,1.0,0.428005576133728
What characteristic of large language model (LLM) generated text's probability function does DetectGPT exploit for detection?,"['DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection\nusing Probability Curvature\nEric Mitchell1Yoonho Lee1Alexander Khazatsky1Christopher D. Manning1Chelsea Finn1\nAbstract\nThe increasing fluency and widespread usage of\nlarge language models (LLMs) highlight the de-\nsirability of corresponding tools aiding detection\nof LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify\na property of the structure of an LLM’s proba-\nbility function that is useful for such detection.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that text sampled\nfrom an LLM tends to occupy negative curva-\nture regions of the model’s log probability func-\ntion. Leveraging this observation, we then define\na new curvature-based criterion for judging if a\npassage is generated from a given LLM. This\napproach, which we call DetectGPT, does not re-\nquire training a separate classifier, collecting a\ndataset of real or generated passages, or explic-\nitly watermarking generated text. It uses only\nlog probabilities computed by the model of in-\nterest and random perturbations of the passage\nfrom another generic pre-trained language model\n(e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discrimi-\nnative than existing zero-shot methods for model\nsample detection, notably improving detection of\nfake news articles generated by 20B parameter\nGPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest\nzero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for Detect-\nGPT. See ericmitchell.ai/detectgpt\nfor code, data, and other project information.\n1. Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have proven able to gen-\nerate remarkably fluent responses to a wide variety of user\nqueries. Models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022), and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022)\ncan convincingly answer complex questions about science,\nmathematics, historical and current events, and social trends.\n1Stanford University.

Finally, Figure 10 shows an\nanalysis of DetectGPT’s performance as a function of pas-\nsage length. We bin the paired human- and model-generated\nsequences by their average length into three bins of equal\nsize (bottom/middle/top third), and plot the AUROC within\neach bin. The relationship between detection performance\nand passage length generally depends on the dataset and\nmodel (or tokenizer). For very long sequences, DetectGPT\nmay see reduced performance because our implementation\nof DetectGPT applies all T5 mask-filling perturbations at\nonce, and T5 may fail to track many mask tokens at once.\nBy applying perturbations in multiple sequential rounds of\nsmaller numbers of masks, this effect may be mitigated.\n6. Discussion\nAs large language models continue to improve, they will\nbecome increasingly attractive tools for replacing human\nwriters in a variety of contexts, such as education, jour-\nnalism, and art.

The\nresulting method, DetectGPT, is summarized in Alg. 1. Hav-\ning described an application of the perturbation discrepancy\nto machine-generated text detection, we next provide an\ninterpretation of this quantity.\nInterpretation of perturbation discrepancy as curvature\nWhile Figure 3 suggests that the perturbation discrepancy\nmay be useful, it is not immediately obvious what it mea-\nsures. In this section, we show that the perturbation dis-\ncrepancy approximates a measure of the local curvature\nof the log probability function near the candidate passage,\nmore specifically, that it is proportional to the negative trace\nof the Hessian of the log probability function.2To han-\ndle the non-differentiability of discrete data, we consider\ncandidate passages in a latent semantic space, where small\ndisplacements correspond to valid edits that retain similar\nmeaning to the original. Because our perturbation function\n(T5) models natural text, we expect our perturbations to\nroughly capture such meaningful variations of the original\npassage, rather than arbitrary edits.\nWe first invoke Hutchinson’s trace estimator (Hutchinson,\n1990), giving an unbiased estimate of the trace of matrix A:\ntr(A) =Ezz⊤Az (2)\nprovided that the elements of z∼qzare IID with E[zi] = 0\nandVar(zi) = 1 .

What datasets were used for BERT's pre-training and why?,"['is a\nlarge-scale reading comprehension dataset with\nmore than 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000\nquestions. The dataset is collected from English\nexaminations in China, which are designed for\nmiddle and high school students. In RACE, each\npassage is associated with multiple questions. For\nevery question, the task is to select one correct an-\nswer from four options.

The orig-\ninal BERT implementation performed masking\nonce during data preprocessing, resulting in a sin-\nglestatic mask. To avoid using the same mask for\neach training instance in every epoch, training data\nwas duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is\nmasked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of\ntraining. Thus, each training sequence was seen\nwith the same mask four times during training.\nWe compare this strategy with dynamic mask-\ningwhere we generate the masking pattern every\ntime we feed a sequence to the model.

The test\ncovers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,\nlaw, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ', '57tasks. On the right are UniﬁedQA\ntransfer accuracies for all of the 57tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes. We ﬁnd that while many of\nthese mistakes were clearly wrong, ']","The findings highlighted that while recent models like GPT-3 have made progress, they exhibit lopsided performance across different subjects, lack expert-level accuracy, and struggle with procedural knowledge and tasks requiring calculations.","The key findings regarding the models' performance on the multitask test were that most recent models had near random-chance accuracy, with the very largest GPT-3 model improving over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average.

This is probably owing to GLM-130B’s bidirectional context attention and MIP,\nwhich has been proved to improve zero-shot results in unseen tasks (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al.,\n2022). As the number of shots increases, GLM-130B’s performance keeps going up, maintaining its\noutperformance over GPT-3 (Cf. Appendix C.5 and Table 14 for details on each model and task).\nLimitations and Discussions. In the experiments above, we observe that GLM-130B’s performance\ngrowth (13.31 to 15.12) with the increase of few-shot samples is not as significant as GPT-3’s (4.35\nto 13.18). Here is our intuitive attempt to understand the phenomenon.\nFirst, the bidirectional nature of GLM-130B could lead to strong zero-shot performance (as is indi-\ncated in zero-shot language modeling), thus getting closer to the few-shot “upper-bound” for models\nof similar scale (i.e., 100B-scale) than unidirectional LLMs. Second, it may be also attributed to a\ndeficit of existing MIP paradigms (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022), which only involve zero-shot\nprediction in the training and will be likely to bias GLM-130B for stronger zero-shot learning but\nrelatively weaker in-context few-shot performance. To correct the bias, a potential solution we came\nup with would be to employ MIP with varied shots of in-context samples rather than only zero-shot\nsamples.\nFinally, despite almost the same GPT architecture as GPT-3, PaLM 540B’s relative growth with few-\nshot in-context learning is substantially more significant than GPT-3’s. We conjecture this further\nacceleration in performance growth is a source of PaLM’s high-quality and diverse private-collected\ntraining corpora.

These few-shot\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the ']","LLaMA's training data includes a mixture of sources like CommonCrawl, C4, GitHub, Wikipedia, and others, preprocessed with techniques like deduplication, language identification, and quality filtering, emphasizing the use of publicly available data.","LLaMA's training data preprocessing and mixture differ from other large language models in that they train their models on trillions of tokens using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets.",1.0,1.0,0.7510268688201904

To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ']","Models like GPT-3 are poorly calibrated, with their confidence often not accurately reflecting their actual performance across different subjects, indicating a need for improvement in model calibration techniques.","The models like GPT-3 are found to be uncalibrated, meaning that their confidence in their predictions does not accurately reflect their actual accuracy on the multitask test. This discrepancy between confidence and accuracy can reach up to 24% in some cases, indicating a lack of calibration in these models. The calibration error, especially in the zero-shot setting, suggests that there is room for improvement in model calibration.",1.0,1.0,0.6926547288894653

At\nleast one major news source has released AI-written content\nwith limited human review, leading to substantial factual er-\nrors in some articles (Christian, 2023).

The\nresulting method, DetectGPT, is summarized in Alg. 1. Hav-\ning described an application of the perturbation discrepancy\nto machine-generated text detection, we next provide an\ninterpretation of this quantity.\nInterpretation of perturbation discrepancy as curvature\nWhile Figure 3 suggests that the perturbation discrepancy\nmay be useful, it is not immediately obvious what it mea-\nsures. In this section, we show that the perturbation dis-\ncrepancy approximates a measure of the local curvature\nof the log probability function near the candidate passage,\nmore specifically, that it is proportional to the negative trace\nof the Hessian of the log probability function.2To han-\ndle the non-differentiability of discrete data, we consider\ncandidate passages in a latent semantic space, where small\ndisplacements correspond to valid edits that retain similar\nmeaning to the original. Because our perturbation function\n(T5) models natural text, we expect our perturbations to\nroughly capture such meaningful variations of the original\npassage, rather than arbitrary edits.\nWe first invoke Hutchinson’s trace estimator (Hutchinson,\n1990), giving an unbiased estimate of the trace of matrix A:\ntr(A) =Ezz⊤Az (2)\nprovided that the elements of z∼qzare IID with E[zi] = 0\nandVar(zi) = 1 . To use Equation 2 to estimate the trace\nof the Hessian of fatx, we must therefore compute the\nexpectation of the directional second derivative z⊤Hf(x)z.\nWe approximate this expression with finite differences:\nz⊤Hf(x)z≈f(x+hz) +f(x−hz)−2f(x)\nh2(3)\nCombining Equations 2 and 3 ', '8.

Averaging up to 100 perturbations greatly increases\nDetectGPT’s reliability. Perturbations sampled from T5-large.\nlarly how the domain impacts the threshold separating the\nperturbation discrepancy distributions of model-generated\nand human texts as well as the impact of passage length on\ndetection. Figure 9 shows the perturbation discrepancy dis-\ntributions for model-generated and human texts across four\ndata distributions, using GPT-Neo-2.7B to generate sam-\nples. A threshold of slightly below 0.1 separates human and\nmodel texts across data distributions, which is important for\npractical scenarios in which a passage may be analyzed with-\nout knowing its domain a priori. Finally, Figure 10 shows an\nanalysis of DetectGPT’s performance as a function of pas-\nsage length. We bin the paired human- and model-generated\nsequences by their average length into three bins of equal\nsize (bottom/middle/top third), and plot the AUROC within\neach bin. The relationship between detection performance\nand passage length generally depends on the dataset and\nmodel (or tokenizer). For very long sequences, DetectGPT\nmay see reduced performance because our implementation\nof DetectGPT applies all T5 mask-filling perturbations at\nonce, and T5 may fail to track many mask tokens at once.\nBy applying perturbations in multiple sequential rounds of\nsmaller numbers of masks, this effect may be mitigated.\n6. Discussion\nAs large language models continue to improve, they will\nbecome increasingly attractive tools for replacing human\nwriters in a variety of contexts, such as education, jour-\nnalism, and art.

What core challenge does HellaSwag aim to address in the context of state-of-the-art models' capabilities in commonsense natural language inference (NLI)?,"['of T0 (3B and 11B), as well as their non-\ninstruction-tuned version, T5 LM-Adapted (Lester\net al., 2021), as a baseline.\nVery Large Model Lastly, we experiment with\nthe largest GPT-3 (175B) via priming (a.k.a. in-\ncontext learning). Although ﬁne-tuning is techni-\ncally available, it is extremely limited by OpenAI’s\nvarious quotas. See Appendix B for details on how\nwe circumvent challenges in reproducing Brown\net al. (2020)’s results.\nData NLI is a task where a model is asked to\nclassify whether one piece of text (the “premise”)\nentails another (the “hypothesis”). We focus on NLI\nbecause all T0 variants holds out all NLI prompts\nand all NLI datasets in its training, which makes it\na fair comparison to other models in this paper.\nWe use Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE,\nDagan et al., 2006, inter alios), a series of expert-\nannotated NLI datasets. Speciﬁcally, we use the\nSuperGLUE collection of RTE (i.e., RTE1, 2, 3,\nand 5; all converted to binary classiﬁcation) and\nreport their validation accuracy for comparability\nwith prior work on prompts.\nWe also experiment with Adversarial NLI\n(ANLI, Nie et al., 2020), Heuristic Analysis for\n3\x0cNLI Systems (HANS, McCoy et al., 2019), and\nWinograd Schema Challenge (WSC, Levesque\net al., 2012), reported in Appendices G.2, K, and\nL, respectively.

In addition to the masked lan-\nguage modeling objective, the model is trained to\npredict whether the observed document segments\ncome from the same or distinct documents via an\nauxiliary Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) loss.\nThe NSP loss was hypothesized to be an impor-\ntant factor in training the original BERT model.\nDevlin et al.

This strategy ensures a richer variety of training examples and prevents the model from overfitting to a specific masked pattern.","The dynamic masking strategy in RoBERTa differs from BERT's static masking in that RoBERTa replaces the input words in three different ways: 80% of the time with the [MASK] token, 10% of the time with a random word, and 10% of the time keeping the word unchanged to bias the representation towards the actual observed word. This approach forces the model to maintain a distributional contextual representation of every input token. The advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, leading to more efficient training and better language understanding capability.",1.0,1.0,0.7803385257720947

While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites.

How does DetectGPT's approach to machine-generated text detection differ from previous zero-shot methods?,"['al.,\n2023) may further improve the effectiveness of methods\nsuch as DetectGPT, even as LLMs continue to improve.\nLimitations. One limitation of probability-based methods\nfor zero-shot machine-generated text detection (like Detect-\nGPT) is the white-box assumption that we can evaluate log\nprobabilities of the model(s) in question. For models be-\nhind APIs that do provide probabilities (such as GPT-3),\nevaluating probabilities nonetheless costs money. Another\nassumption of DetectGPT is access to a reasonable pertur-\nbation function.

Finally, DetectGPT is more\ncompute-intensive than other methods for detection, as it\nrequires sampling and scoring the set of perturbations for\neach candidate passage, rather than just the candidate pas-\nsage; a better tuned perturbation function or more efficient\ncurvature approximation may help mitigate these costs.\nFuture Work.

Describe the triple loss used in DistilBERT's training and its components.,"['feature) contains\nabout the joint distribution pw(x,y) = ˆp(x)pw(y|x): If the\nclassiﬁcation performance for a given task does not depend\nstrongly a parameter, the corresponding entry in the FIM\nwill be small. The FIM is also related to the (Kolmogorov)\ncomplexity of a task, a property that can be used to de-\nﬁne a computable metric of the learning distance between\ntasks [3]. Finally, the FIM can be interpreted as an easy-to-\ncompute positive semideﬁnite upper-bound to the Hessian\nof the cross-entropy loss, and coincides with it at local min-\nima [24]. In particular, “ﬂat minima” correspond to weights\nthat have, on average, low (Fisher) information [5, 13].\x0c2.1. TASK 2VECembedding using a probe network\nWhile the network activations capture the information in\nthe input image which are needed to infer the image label,\nthe FIM indicates the set of feature maps which are more\ninformative for solving the current task. Following this in-\ntuition, we use the FIM to represent the task itself. How-\never, the FIMs computed on different networks are not di-\nrectly comparable. To address this, we use single “probe”\nnetwork pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor and\nre-train only the classiﬁer layer on any given task, which\nusually can be done efﬁciently. After training is complete,\nwe compute the FIM for the feature extractor parameters.\nSince the full FIM is unmanageably large for rich probe\nnetworks based on CNNs, we make two additional approxi-\nmations. First, we only consider the diagonal entries, which\nimplicitly assumes that correlations between different ﬁlters\nin the probe network are not important. Second, since the\nweights in each ﬁlter are usually not independent, we aver-\nage the Fisher Information for all weights in the same ', 'of models.\nIn supervised learning, a classiﬁcation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\nclasses. But some of these ""near-zero"" probabilities are larger than others and reﬂect, in part, the\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\nthe teacher: Lce=∑\niti∗log(si)where ti(resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\n(resp. the student). This objective results in a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher\ndistribution. Following Hinton et al. [2015] we used a softmax-temperature :pi=exp(zi/T)∑\njexp(zj/T)\nwhere Tcontrols the smoothness of the output distribution and ziis the model score for the class i.\nThe same temperature Tis applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference,\nTis set to 1 to recover a standard softmax .\nThe ﬁnal training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss Lcewith the supervised\ntraining loss, in our case the masked language modeling lossLmlm [Devlin et al., 2018]. We found it\nbeneﬁcial to add a cosine embedding loss (Lcos) which will tend to align the directions of the student\nand teacher hidden states vectors.\n3 DistilBERT: a distilled version of BERT\nStudent architecture In the present work, the student - DistilBERT - has ']","The triple loss in DistilBERT's training combines distillation loss (Lce), masked language modeling loss (Lmlm), and cosine embedding loss (Lcos), aiming to retain performance while reducing model size.",None,0.75,1.0,0.11587969213724136
What advantages does DistilBERT present for on-device computations and mobile applications?,"['inference speed\nTo further investigate the speed-up/size trade-off of DistilBERT, we compare (in Table 3) the number\nof parameters of each model along with the inference time needed to do a full pass on the STS-\nB development set on CPU (Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 Haswell @2.9GHz) using a batch size of 1.\nDistilBERT has 40% fewer parameters than BERT and is 60% faster than BERT.\nOn device computation We studied whether DistilBERT could be used for on-the-edge applications\nby building a mobile application for question answering. We compare the average inference time on\na recent smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) against our previously trained question answering model based\non BERT-base. Excluding the tokenization step, DistilBERT is 71% faster than BERT, and the whole\nmodel weighs 207 MB (which could be further reduced with quantization). Our code is available5.\n4.2 Ablation study\nIn this section, we investigate the inﬂuence of various components of the triple loss and the student\ninitialization on the performances of the distilled model. We report the macro-score on GLUE. Table 4\npresents the deltas with the full triple loss: removing the Masked Language Modeling loss has little\nimpact while the two distillation losses account for a large portion of the performance.\n5 Related work\nTask-speciﬁc distillation Most of the prior works focus on building task-speciﬁc distillation se-\ntups.

As a result, researchers\nwho cannot afford powerful data-center GPU servers like DGX-A100 can also utilize GLM-130B.\nG.2 I MPACT ON INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS AND SMALL COMPANIES\nCurrently, individual developers and small companies who want to integrate LLMs into their busi-\nness can only choose paid inference APIs. The increased cost can hinder their attempts. Instead,\nGLM-130B can be deployed on popularized hardware that they own or can access via cloud service\nto reduce the cost. Furthermore, they can utilize distillation techniques Sanh et al. (2019); Jiao et al.\n(2020) to obtain smaller models that preserve comparable performance on their specific tasks. While\nsome developers may lack the ability to complete deployment and distillation on their own, we be-\nlieve with GLM-130B and more open LLMs in the future, the corresponding toolkits and service\nproviders will become more available.\nWe also note that currently most applications of LLMs are based on prompt engineering, partly\ndue to the limitation of inference APIs. In downstream scenarios such as online customer service,\nthe companies accumulate huge amounts of human-generated data that contain domain knowledge.\nWith the open-source weights and code, developers can finetune GLM-130B on their own data to\nmitigate the gap of domain knowledge.\nG.3 S OCIAL IMPACT\nLarge language models, together ']","DistilBERT's reduced size and faster inference capabilities make it highly suitable for on-device computations, demonstrated through a mobile application for question answering.","DistilBERT is 60% faster than BERT and 71% faster than BERT on on-device computations and mobile applications.

(2018). Details:\na. On each iteration, we split the dataset up into\n80% training and 20% testing. We don’t do\nanything special for this split (like looking at\nthe video /article IDs).\nb. For ActivityNet, we use k“9 assigned in-\ndices for every example. (This corresponds to\nthe number of red columns in Figure 2). For\nWikiHow, we used k“5, since we found\nthat there were fewer good endings produced\nby the generators after scaling up the sequence\nlength.\nc. Similarly to Zellers et al. (2018), we train the\nAF models in a multi-way fashion. Since\nwe use BERT-Large as the discriminator, this\nmatches Devlin et al. (2018)’s model for\nSWAG: on each training example, the model\nis given exactly one positive ending and sev-\neral negative endings, and the model com-\nputes probability distribution over the endings\nthrough a softmax. However, we also wanted\nto always report 4-way probability for simplic-\nity. To do this, we train in a 4-way setting (the\ntraining set is constructed by subsampling 3\nwrong answers from the set of kthat are cur-\nrently assigned to each example). The accu-\nracy values that are reported are done so using\nthe ﬁrst 3 assigned negatives in dataset Dtest.\nd.

For\neach question, a model is given a context from a\nvideo caption and four ending choices for what\nmight happen next. Only one choice is right – the\nactual next caption of the video.\nObtaining interesting negatives is challenging.\nPrior work (e.g. Gururangan et al., 2018; Poliak\net al., 2018) has found that when humans write the\nendings to NLI questions, they introduce subtle\nyet strong class-conditional biases known as an-\nnotation artifacts .3\nTo address this, Zellers et al.

What is the impact of removing the NSP loss on RoBERTa's performance across various benchmarks compared to BERT?,"['tokens as FULL -\nSENTENCES . We remove the NSP loss.\nResults Table 2shows results for the four dif-\nferent settings. We ﬁrst compare the original\nSEGMENT -PAIR input format from Devlin et al.\n(2019 ) to the SENTENCE -PAIR format; both for-\nmats retain the NSP loss, but the latter uses sin-\ngle sentences. We ﬁnd that using individual\nsentences hurts performance on downstream\ntasks , which we hypothesize is because the model\nis not able to learn long-range dependencies.We next compare training without the NSP\nloss and training with blocks of text from a sin-\ngle document ( DOC-SENTENCES ). We ﬁnd that\nthis setting outperforms the originally published\nBERT BASEresults and that removing the NSP loss\nmatches or slightly improves downstream task\nperformance , in contrast to Devlin et al. (2019 ).\nIt is possible that the original BERT implementa-\ntion may only have removed the loss term while\nstill retaining the SEGMENT -PAIR input format.\nFinally we ﬁnd that restricting sequences to\ncome from a single document ( DOC-SENTENCES )\nperforms slightly better than packing sequences\nfrom multiple documents ( FULL -SENTENCES ).\nHowever, because the DOC-SENTENCES format\nresults in variable batch sizes, we use FULL -\nSENTENCES in the remainder of our experiments\nfor easier comparison with related work.\n4.3 Training with large batches\nPast work in Neural Machine Translation has\nshown that training with very large mini-batches\ncan both improve optimization speed and end-task\nperformance when the learning rate is increased\nappropriately ( Ott et al. ,2018 ). Recent work has\nshown that BERT is also amenable to large batch\ntraining ( You et al. ,2019 ).\nDevlin et al. (2019 ) originally trained\nBERT BASE for 1M steps with a batch size of\n256 sequences. This is ', 'and replacement is performed once in the be-\nginning and saved for the duration of training, al-\nthough in practice, data is duplicated so the mask\nis not always the same for every training sentence\n(see Section 4.1).\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP) NSP is a bi-\nnary classiﬁcation loss for predicting whether two\nsegments follow each other in the original text.\nPositive examples are created by taking consecu-\ntive sentences from the text corpus. Negative ex-\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\nare sampled with equal probability.\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve\nperformance on downstream tasks, such as Natural\nLanguage Inference ( Bowman et al. ,2015 ), which\nrequire reasoning about the relationships between\npairs of sentences.\n2.4 Optimization\nBERT is optimized with Adam ( Kingma and Ba ,\n2015 ) using the following parameters: β1= 0.9,\nβ2= 0.999,ǫ=1e-6 and L2weight de-\ncay of0.01. The learning rate is warmed up\nover the ﬁrst 10,000 steps to a peak value of\n1e-4, and then linearly decayed. BERT trains\nwith a dropout of 0.1 on all layers and at-\ntention weights, and a GELU activation func-\ntion ( Hendrycks and Gimpel ,2016 ). Models are\npretrained for S=1,000,000 updates, with mini-\nbatches containing B=256 sequences of maxi-\nmum length T=512 tokens.\n2.5 Data\nBERT is trained on a combination of B OOK COR-\nPUS (Zhu et al. ,2015 ) plus English W IKIPEDIA ,\nwhich totals 16GB of uncompressed text.3\n3 Experimental Setup\nIn this section, we describe the experimental setup\nfor our replication study of BERT.\n3.1 Implementation\nWe reimplement BERT in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).

This finding challenges the initial hypothesis that NSP is crucial for learning sentence relationships, suggesting that masked language modeling alone, under optimal conditions, is sufficient for achieving superior performance.","The impact of removing the NSP loss on RoBERTa's performance across various benchmarks is that it matches or slightly improves downstream task performance, unlike BERT where performance is hurt when using individual sentences without the NSP loss.",1.0,1.0,0.7235570549964905

What computational approach does PAL use to integrate programmatic reasoning within natural language tasks?,"['PAL: Program-aided Language Models\nLuyu Gao* 1Aman Madaan* 1Shuyan Zhou* 1Uri Alon1Pengfei Liu1 2Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1\nGraham Neubig1 2\n{luyug,amadaan,shuyanzh,ualon,pliu3,yiming,callan,gneubig }@cs.cmu.edu\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (“few-\nshot prompting”). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a\nneural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13\nmathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reason-\ning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other bench-\nmarks. In all these natural language reasoning\ntasks, generating code using an LLM and rea-\nsoning using a Python interpreter leads to more\naccurate results than much larger models.

What specific challenges do the tasks in SuperGLUE address in natural language processing?,"['high-level goals, the original version of\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\nMore challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remaining tasks\nwere identiﬁed from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on\ndifﬁculty for current NLP approaches.\nMore diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair\nclassiﬁcation. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution\nand question answering (QA).\nComprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all benchmark\ntasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and\nhuman performance.\nImproved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on\npretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including\nPyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).\nReﬁned usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been\nrevamped to ensure fair ', 'corresponds well to human\njudgments of output quality. Some text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues with\nautomatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).\n4\x0cPublic data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks\ninvolved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create)\na test set with private labels.\nTask format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentiviz-\ning the users of the benchmark to create complex task-speciﬁc model architectures. Still, while GLUE\nis restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand\nthe scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding\nindividual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\nLicense: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research\npurposes.\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the\nNLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according\nto our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 ']","The tasks challenge models on various fronts, including deep textual understanding, commonsense reasoning, fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and the ability to handle ambiguity and complexity in language, reflecting a broad spectrum of NLP challenges.","The tasks in SuperGLUE address challenges in natural language processing related to sample-efficient learning, transfer learning, multitask learning, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.

However, it has been real-\nized that it is computationally unaffordable to explore various architectural designs for LLMs. We\nintroduce and explain the unique design choices of GLM-130B.\n2.1 GLM-130B’ SARCHITECTURE\nGLM as Backbone. Most recent 100B-scale LLMs, such as GPT-3, PaLM, OPT, and BLOOM,\nfollow the traditional GPT-style (Radford et al., 2019) architecture of decoder-only autoregressive\nlanguage modeling. In GLM-130B, we instead make an attempt to explore the potential of a bidi-\nrectional GLM—General Language Model (Du et al., 2022)—as its backbone.\nGLM is a transformer-based language model that leverages autoregressive blank infilling as its train-\ning objective. Briefly, for a ']","By leveraging the GLM architecture's unique scaling law, GLM-130B achieves INT4 weight quantization, reducing memory requirements for inference with minimal performance degradation.","GLM-130B manages to achieve INT4 weight quantization without post-training due to its unique architecture and weight distribution characteristics. The weight value distributions in GLM-130B are narrower compared to similar-sized GPT models, allowing for quantization with larger bins and minimal precision loss. This results in negligible performance degradation (-0.74% on LAMBADA and +0.05% on MMLU) compared to uncompressed models like GPT-3. The benefits of achieving INT4 weight quantization without post-training include saving GPU memory, enabling fast inference with performance guarantee, and maintaining performance advantages over GPT-3 on common benchmarks.",1.0,1.0,0.8463802337646484

Data and Model Parallelism in Deep Learning\nThere are two central paradigms for scaling out deep neu-\nral network training to numerous hardware accelerators:\ndata parallelism (Valiant, 1990) where a training minibatch\nis split across multiple workers, and model parallelism in\nwhich the memory usage and computation of a model is\ndistributed across multiple workers. By increasing the mini-\nbatch size proportionally to the number of available work-\ners (i.e. weak scaling ), one observes near linear scaling\nin training data throughput. However, large batch train-\ning introduces complications into the optimization process\nthat can result in reduced accuracy or longer time to conver-\ngence, offsetting the beneﬁt of increased training throughput\n(Keskar et al., 2017). Further research (Goyal et al., 2017;\nYou et al., 2017; 2019) has developed techniques to miti-gate these effects and drive down the training time of large\nneural networks. To scale out training even further, parallel\nwork (Chen et al., 2016) has combined data parallelism with\nactivation checkpointing: recomputing activations in the\nbackward pass without storing them in the forward pass to\nreduce memory requirements.\nHowever, these techniques have one fundamental limitation\nin the ']"," It rearranges the order of layer normalization and residual connections, allowing for stable training and enhanced accuracies as model size increases.","Megatron-LM contributes to rearranging the order of layer normalization and residual connections, as shown in Figure 7, which is critical to enable the scaling of BERT-style models beyond BERT-Large.

The data parallelism (Valiant, 1990) and tensor model paral-\nlelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019) are the de facto practices for training billion-scale models (Wang &\nKomatsuzaki, 2021; Du et al., 2022).

How does the inclusion of specific metadata in CodeNet facilitate a wide range of code analysis tasks?,"['for source code exist, with many targeting one or a small number of\ntasks. Such tasks include clone detection, vulnerability detection [ 10,11], cloze test [ 12], code\ncompletion [ 13,14], code repair [ 15], code-to-code translation, natural language code search [ 16],\ntext-to-code generation [ 17], and code summarization [ 16]. A detailed discussion of several of these\ntasks and their respective datasets is available in CodeXGLUE [ 18], which is a collection of existing\ndatasets. CodeNet, on the other hand, is a new dataset curated from scratch, that aims to support a\nbroad set of use cases. Popular datasets of a similar kind are POJ-104 [ 19] (which is incorporated as\npart of CodeXGLUE as well) and GCJ [ 20] (derived from Google Code Jam). We compare CodeNet\nto these datasets in the following.\n3.1 POJ-104\nPOJ-104 was collected from a pedagogical online judge system. The code samples are submissions\nto 104 programming problems. With 500 submissions to each problem, there is a total of 52,000 code\nsamples in the dataset. This dataset has been used by many authors for code classiﬁcation [ 19] and\ncode similarity [21].\nPOJ-104 is faced with several limitations.\n1.The code samples are in C and C++, but the two languages are not distinguished. Although they are\nclosely related, mixing them leads to parsing errors and a reduction of useful code samples [21].\n2.Useful metadata such as the results of the judging system (acceptance, error types etc.) are missing.\nTherefore, for certain applications where compilabilty or code correctness is important, additional\npre-processing efforts are needed and useful code samples are reduced [ 21]. The dataset does\nnot contain the ', 'types of errors,\naccordingly labeled. The submissions are in many different languages.\nCode Samples. Each code sample is a single ﬁle and includes inputting the test cases and printing out\nthe computed results. The ﬁle name uses standard extensions that denote the programming language,\ne.g.,.pyfor Python. The majority of code samples contain only one function, although submissions\nto more complex problems might have several functions.\n2\x0c(a) Languages (b) Status\nFigure 1: Percentage of submissions per language (left) and per status (right).\nMetadata. The metadata enables data queries and selections among the large collection of problems,\nlanguages, and source ﬁles. The metadata is organized in a two level hierarchy. The ﬁrst is the\ndataset level, which describes all problems. The second is the problem level, which details all the\nsubmissions to a single problem. Metadata and data are separated in the dataset structure.\nAt the dataset level, a single CSV ﬁle lists all problems and their origins, along with the CPU time\nand memory limits set for them. Additionally, every problem has an HTML ﬁle with a detailed\ndescription of the problem, the requirements and constraints, and the IO examples.\nAt the problem level, every problem has a CSV ﬁle. The metadata for each submission is summarized\nin Table 2 below, which lists the ﬁelds contained in each CSV ﬁle as well as the corresponding\ndescriptions.\n2.1 How to read the CodeNet dataset\nThe data and metadata are organized in a rigorous directory structure.

"What types of tasks are included in SuperGLUE, and how do they enhance the benchmark's complexity?","['high-level goals, the original version of\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\nMore challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remaining tasks\nwere identiﬁed from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on\ndifﬁculty for current NLP approaches.\nMore diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair\nclassiﬁcation. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution\nand question answering (QA).\nComprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all benchmark\ntasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and\nhuman performance.\nImproved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on\npretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including\nPyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).\nReﬁned usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been\nrevamped to ensure fair ', 'corresponds well to human\njudgments of output quality. Some text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues with\nautomatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).\n4\x0cPublic data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks\ninvolved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create)\na test set with private labels.\nTask format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentiviz-\ning the users of the benchmark to create complex task-speciﬁc model architectures. Still, while GLUE\nis restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand\nthe scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding\nindividual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\nLicense: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research\npurposes.\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the\nNLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according\nto our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 ']","SuperGLUE includes eight diverse tasks such as Boolean Questions (BoolQ), Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA), and Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), enhancing complexity through a mix of question answering, natural language inference, coreference resolution, and word sense disambiguation tasks.","The types of tasks included in SuperGLUE are more diverse compared to GLUE.

In what ways does GLM-130B's bilingual capability extend its application compared to monolingual models?,"['Jie\nTang\n•Project Leader: Jie Tang\nE.5 C OMPUTATION SPONSOR\n•GPU Sponsor: Zhipu.AI\n52\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nF A B RIEF HISTORY OF GLM-130B\nThe GLM-130B project16was conceived in Dec. 2021 in a brainstorming meeting at Tsinghua KEG.\nWe firmly believe that it is of value to pre-train a highly accurate language model, in particular for\nboth Chinese and English. Though GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the pioneer for this effort, it is not\navailable to most people in the world. In addition, it supports English only. We therefore decide to\ninitialize the project GLM-130B. Please note that the WuDao 1.75T model we built last year is a\nsparse model with 480 mixture-of-experts (MoE), rather than a dense one as GPT-3. Our goal then\nis to train a bilingual pre-trained dense model with high accuracy on downstream tasks, and to make\nit open to everyone in the world-anyone, anywhere can download it and use it on a single server with\nappropriate GPUs.\nThe ambitious project soon faced several important challenges:\n•Lack of computational resources : No organization is willing to sponsor such a big project and\nfreely make it public.\n•Lack of a robust pre-training algorithm : Despite GPT-3’s success on English corpus, it is\nunclear how to train a high-accurate bilingual model for both English and Chinese.\n•Lack of fast inference solutions : Since the goal is to have the model public to everyone, we need\nto design fast inference solutions with low resource requirements to run the model.\nFor the pre-training algorithm, we finally chose GLM (Du et al., 2022) due to its high performance\nin practice.

Introduction\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) ', 'problem size they can tackle: the model must ﬁt\nentirely on one worker. With language models of increasing\nsize and complexity like BERT and GPT-2, neural networks\nhave approached the memory capacity of modern hardware\naccelerators. One solution to this problem is to employ\nparameter sharing to reduce the memory footprint of the\nmodel (Lan et al., 2019), but this limits the overall capacity\nof the model. Our approach is to utilize model parallelism\nto split the model across multiple accelerators. This not\nonly alleviates the memory pressure, but also increases the\namount of parallelism independently of the microbatch size.\nWithin model parallelism, there are two further paradigms:\nlayer-wise pipeline parallelism, and more general distributed\ntensor computation. In pipeline model parallelism, groups\nof operations are performed on one device before the outputs\nare passed to the next device in the pipeline where a differ-\nent group of operations are performed. Some approaches\n(Harlap et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018) use a parameter\nserver (Li et al., 2014) in conjunction with pipeline par-\nallelism. However these suffer from inconsistency issues.\nThe GPipe framework for TensorFlow (Huang et al., 2018)\novercomes this inconsistency issue by using synchronous\ngradient decent. This approach requires additional logic to\nhandle the efﬁcient pipelining of these communication and\ncomputation operations, and suffers from pipeline bubbles\nthat reduce efﬁciency, or changes to the optimizer itself\nwhich impact accuracy.\nDistributed tensor computation is an orthogonal and more\ngeneral approach that partitions a tensor operation across\nmultiple devices to accelerate computation or increase\nmodel size. FlexFlow (Jia et al., 2018), a deep learning\nframework orchestrating such parallel computation, pro-\nvides a method to pick the best parallelization strategy.

AI can manipulate and generate computer code, but can it do so with\nhigh quality? Many researchers are fascinated by this possibility, encouraged by AI successes in\nother domains and tantalized by the vision of computers programming computers.

Under review.arXiv:2105.12655v2 [cs.SE] 29 Aug 2021\x0cGiven the success of non-AI tools for code, why should we consider AI to augment or possibly\nreplace them? Firstly, AI can help reﬁne and re-tune the heuristics used by traditional coding tools.\nSecondly, based on the training data from past experience, AI can help prioritize when there is more\nthan one sound answer [ 5]. Thirdly, an AI-based tool may handle incomplete or invalid code more\nrobustly, thus expanding its scope. Finally, AI can incorporate signals usually ignored by traditional\ntools for code, such as the natural language in identiﬁers or comments.\nIn the enterprise environment, developers often face code written by large teams over many years\nand geographies. Developers must manipulate such code to modernize it, ﬁx bugs, improve its\nperformance, evolve it when ', 'requirements change, make it more secure, and/or comply with regu-\nlations. These tasks are challenging, and it is crucial to provide tool support for developers to be\nmore productive at performing them. It is well known that the latest advancements in deep learning\nalgorithms rely on best-of-breed datasets, such as ImageNet, to create increasingly complex and\npowerful models. In this paper, we present ""CodeNet"", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind dataset in scale, diversity,\nand quality, to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code.\nTo promote widespread adoption of CodeNet, we will be launching contests involving use cases based\non the dataset. The ﬁrst contest [ 6] will focus on diversity, inclusion and spurring interest among\naspiring data scientists. We are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization (with\npresence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [ 7] and targeting teams with at least\nﬁfty percent women.

On the diagnostics, all models continue to lag signiﬁcantly behind humans.\nThough all models obtain near perfect gender parity scores on Winogender, this is due to the fact that\nthey are obtaining accuracy near that of random guessing.\n6 Conclusion\nWe present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark for evaluating general-purpose language understanding\nsystems. SuperGLUE updates the GLUE benchmark by identifying a new set of challenging NLU\ntasks, as measured by the difference between human and machine baselines. The set of eight tasks in\nour benchmark emphasizes diverse task formats and low-data training data tasks, with nearly half the\ntasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\nfor work developing new general-purpose ']","SuperGLUE's human baseline performances were established through careful collection of non-expert annotations for a sample of each test set, following structured annotation procedures that included a short training phase for annotators, ensuring reliable estimates of human performance.",None,1.0,0.0,0.14546120166778564
