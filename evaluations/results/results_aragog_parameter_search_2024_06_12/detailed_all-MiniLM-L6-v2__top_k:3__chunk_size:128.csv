What are the two main tasks BERT is pre-trained on?,"['BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\nwords).\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\ndings during pre-training.\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\nTasks\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT ', 'steps in our\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks.

For WiC, we also concatenate the representation\nof the marked word.

How does BERT's architecture facilitate the use of a unified model across diverse NLP tasks?,"['is a\nlarge-scale reading comprehension dataset with\nmore than 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000\nquestions.

DetectGPT's approach helps to differentiate between text generated by LLMs and human-generated text, which can be crucial in combating misinformation and ensuring the integrity of online content.

The ability to detect machine-generated text can also aid in developing tools and strategies to prevent the misuse of LLMs and to promote ethical and responsible use of these powerful language models.

Describe the process and purpose of the 'Next Sentence Prediction' task in BERT's pre-training.,"['We ﬁne-tune a copy of the pretrained BERT model separately\nfor each task, and leave the development of multi-task learning models to future work.

For WiC, we also concatenate the representation\nof the marked word. For COPA, MultiRC, and ReCoRD, for each answer choice, we similarly\nconcatenate the context with that answer choice and feed the resulting sequence into BERT to produce\nan answer representation. For COPA, we ', 'token is chosen, we replace\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time.

"In the context of PAL, what role do meaningful variable names play in the generated program's effectiveness?","['et al.\n(2021); Madaan et al. (2022). We created prompts that are\nsimilar to PAL’s, except that they do include the ﬁnal answer.\nThis resulted in a 23.2 solve rate on GSM 8K, much lower\nthan PAL(72.0), and only 4.5 points higher than DIRECT .\nThese results reinforce our hypothesis that the main beneﬁt\nofPALcomes from the synergy with the interpreter, andnot only from having a better prompt. Additional details\nare provided in Appendix B. For additional discussion on\nthe advantages of code-prompts over textual-prompts, see\nAppendix G.\nDo variable names matter? In all our experiments, we\nused meaningful variable names in the PALprompts, to ease\nthe model’s grounding of variables to the entities they rep-\nresent. For the Python interpreter, however, variable names\nare meaningless. To measure the importance of meaningful\nvariable names, we experimented with two prompts variants:\n1. P AL−comment – ', 'the PALprompt without intermediate\nNL comments.\n2. P AL−var\n−comment – the PALprompt without intermediate\nNL comments and with variable names substituted\nwith random characters.\nThe results are shown in Figure 9. In COLORED OBJECTED\nandDATE, removing intermediate NL comments but keep-\ning meaningful variable names ( PAL−comment ) – slightly re-\nduces the results compared to the full PALprompt, but it still\nachieves higher accuracy than the baselines COT. Remov-\ning variable names as well ( PAL−var\n−comment ) further decreases\naccuracy, and performs worse than COT. Since variable\nnames have an important part in code quality (Gellenbeck\n& Cook, 1991; Takang et al., 1996), meaningful variable\nnames are only expected to ease reasoning for Codex, which\nwas trained on mostly meaningful names, as was also found\nby Madaan et al. (2022).\n7. Related Work\nPrompting Few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) has\nbeen shown to be an ', 'existing work whenever available, and\notherwise randomly selected the same number (3-6) of ex-\namples as previous work for creating a ﬁxed prompt for\nevery benchmark. In all cases, we augmented the free-form\ntext prompts into PAL-styled prompts, leveraging program-\nming constructs such as for loops and dictionaries when\nneeded. Generally, writing P AL prompts is easy and quick.\nWe also ensure that variable names in the prompt mean-\ningfully reﬂect their roles. For example, a variable that\ndescribes the number of apples in the basket should have a\nname such as numapplesinbasket . This keeps the\ngenerated code linked to the entities in the question. In\nSection 6 we show that such meaningful variable names are\ncritical. Notably, it is also possible to incrementally run\nthe PL segments and feed the execution results back to the\nLLM to generate the following blocks.
