Symmetric and asymmetric TASK 2VECmetrics\nBy construction, the Fisher embedding on which\nTASK 2VEC is based captures fundamental information\x0cabout the structure of the task. We may therefore expect\nthat the distance between two embeddings correlate posi-\ntively with natural metrics on the space of tasks. However,\nthere are two problems in using the Euclidean distance be-\ntween embeddings: the parameters of the network have dif-\nferent scales, and the norm of the embedding is affected by\ncomplexity of the task and the number of samples used to\ncompute the embedding.\nSymmetric TASK 2VEC distance To make the distance\ncomputation robust, we propose to use the cosine distance\nbetween normalized embeddings:\ndsym(Fa,Fb) =dcos(Fa\nFa+Fb,Fb\nFa+Fb)\n,\nwheredcosis the cosine distance, FaandFbare the two\ntask embeddings ( i.e., the diagonal of the Fisher Informa-\ntion computed on the same probe network), and ', 'the division\nis element-wise. This is a symmetric distance which we ex-\npect to capture semantic similarity between two tasks. For\nexample, we show in Fig. 2 that it correlates well with the\ntaxonomical distance between species on iNaturalist.\nOn the other hand, precisely for this reason, this distance\nis ill-suited for tasks such as model selection, where the (in-\ntrinsically asymmetric) transfer distance is more relevant.\nAsymmetric TASK 2VEC distance In a ﬁrst approxima-\ntion, that does not consider either the model or the training\nprocedure used, positive transfer between two tasks depends\nboth on the similarity between two tasks and on the com-\nplexity of the ﬁrst.
