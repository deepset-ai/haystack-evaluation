What are the two main tasks BERT is pre-trained on?,"['BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\nLanguage Understanding\nJacob Devlin Ming-Wei Chang Kenton Lee Kristina Toutanova\nGoogle AI Language\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout }@google.com\nAbstract\nWe introduce a new language representa-\ntion model called BERT , which stands for\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ', 'steps in our\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for ']",Masked LM (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).,None,1.0,1.0,0.052840977907180786

Bi-directional Transformer Results Using BERT\nIn this section, we apply our methodology to BERT-style\ntransformer models and study the effect of model scaling\non several downstream tasks.

How does BERT's performance on the GLUE benchmark compare to previous state-of-the-art models?,"['recent work in this area.\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can\nbe improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate\ndata-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ', ""4: BERT validation accuracy when trained and\nevaluated under several versions of SWAG, with the\nnew dataset HellaSwag as comparison.

"What unique aspect of the LLaMA training dataset distinguishes it from datasets used by models like GPT-3, Chinchilla, and PaLM?","['tasks have\nbeen dramatically improved using LLMs, as these models\nhave been shown to leverage the vast amounts of knowledge\nthey learn from their pre-training corpora (Roberts et al.,\n2020; Petroni et al., 2019; De Cao et al., 2021). However, it\nremains unclear as to what kind of knowledge LMs actually\ncapture—for example, do they simply learn “easy” facts\nthat frequently appear in their pre-training data?\nWe study this question using closed-book QA evalua-\ntions (Roberts et al., 2020) of LLMs in the few-shot set-\nting (Brown et al., 2020). Models are prompted with in-\ncontext training examples (QA pairs) and a test question\nwithout any relevant background text. The goal of our work\nis to investigate the relationship between an LM’s ability\nto answer a question and the number of times information\nrelevant to that question appears in the pre-training data.\nOur Approach The key challenge is to efficiently iden-\ntify all of the documents that are relevant to a particular\nQA pair in pre-training datasets that are hundreds of giga-\nbytes in size. To tackle this, we begin by identifying the\nsalient entities that are contained in a question and its set\nof ground-truth answer aliases. We then identify relevant\npre-training documents by searching for instances where\nthe salient question entity and the answer entity co-occur.\n2\x0cLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\nFor example, consider the question In what city was the\npoet Dante born? with the valid answers Florence ,City of\nFlorence , and Italy (e.g., Figure 2).

What specific enhancements are recommended for language models to bridge the knowledge application gap identified through comprehensive multitask testing?,"['a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level\n(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language\nunderstanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning\nand everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these\nrecent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near\nhuman-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets\nof language understanding.\nTransformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including\nall of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites.

We aim to determine whether a piece of text was gener-\nated by a particular LLM p, such as GPT-3.

If the average log ratio\nis high, the sample is likely from the source model.\nWhile recent work has found that cogent-sounding LLM-\ngenerated responses are often simply wrong (Lin et al.,\n2022), the articulate nature of such generated text may still\nmake LLMs attractive for replacing human labor in some\ncontexts, notably student essay writing and journalism. At\nleast one major news source has released AI-written content\nwith limited human review, leading to substantial factual er-\nrors in some articles (Christian, 2023). Such applications of\nLLMs are problematic for a variety of reasons, making fair\nstudent assessment difficult, impairing student learning, and\nproliferating convincing-but-inaccurate news articles.

As LLMs such as GPT-3 continue to improve in fluency and accuracy, the ability to detect text generated by these models becomes increasingly important to prevent misuse, such as spreading fake news or manipulating information.

DetectGPT's use of probability curvature to determine if a passage is generated by a specific LLM allows for more accurate detection compared to existing zero-shot methods. This is crucial in a landscape where LLMs are being used for tasks like student essay writing and journalism, where the potential for generating misleading or inaccurate content is high. By providing a tool that can help differentiate between LLM-generated text and human-written text, DetectGPT contributes to ensuring the integrity of content and combatting the spread of misinformation.

Overall, DetectGPT's detection approach is significant in addressing the challenges posed by the increasing capabilities of LLMs and the potential for misuse in various applications. It offers a promising solution to enhance the trustworthiness of content generated by LLMs and protect against the negative consequences of their misuse.",0.875,1.0,0.8084321618080139
"How is the student model, DistilBERT, initialized from the teacher model for effective training?","['DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller,\nfaster, cheaper and lighter\nVictor SANH, Lysandre DEBUT, Julien CHAUMOND, Thomas WOLF\nHugging Face\n{victor,lysandre,julien,thomas}@huggingface.co\nAbstract\nAs Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-\nedge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains\nchallenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-\npurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be ﬁne-\ntuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts.\nWhile most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-speciﬁc\nmodels, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show\nthat it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97%\nof its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the\ninductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple\nloss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our\nsmaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its\ncapabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a\ncomparative on-device study.\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released\npretrained language models.The last two years have seen the rise\nof Transfer Learning approaches in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nwith large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels becoming a basic tool in\nmany NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2018,\nRadford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019].\nWhile these models lead to signiﬁ-\ncant improvement, they often have\nseveral hundred million parameters\nand current research1on pre-trained\nmodels indicates that training even\nlarger models still leads to better per-\nformances on downstream tasks.\nThe trend toward bigger models\nraises several concerns. First is the\nenvironmental cost of exponentially ', 'which includes a\ncareful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter\ntuning and training set size. We ﬁnd that BERT\nwas signiﬁcantly undertrained and propose an im-\nproved recipe for training BERT models, which\nwe call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the\nperformance of all of the post-BERT methods.\nOur modiﬁcations are simple, they include: (1)\ntraining the model longer, with bigger batches,\nover more data; (2) removing the next sentence\nprediction objective; (3) training on longer se-\nquences; and (4) dynamically changing the mask-\ning pattern applied to the training data. We also\ncollect a large new dataset (CC-N EWS) of compa-\nrable size to other privately used datasets, to better\ncontrol for training set size effects.\nWhen controlling for training data, our im-\nproved training procedure improves upon the pub-\nlished BERT results on both GLUE and SQuAD.\nWhen trained for longer over additional data, our\nmodel achieves a score of 88.5 on the public\nGLUE leaderboard, matching the 88.4 reported\nbyYang et al. (2019 ). Our model establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art on 4/9 of the GLUE tasks:\nMNLI, QNLI, RTE and STS-B. We also match\nstate-of-the-art results on SQuAD and RACE.\nOverall, we re-establish that BERT’s masked lan-\nguage model training objective is competitive\nwith other recently proposed training objectives\nsuch as perturbed autoregressive language model-\ning (Yang et al. ,2019 ).2\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper\nare: (1) We present a set of important BERT de-\nsign choices and training strategies and introduce\n2It is possible that these other methods could also improve\nwith more tuning.

Explain how BERT uses the 'masked LM' (MLM) for its pre-training.,"['that we only report single-task ﬁne-tuning results\nin this paper. A multitask ﬁne-tuning approach could poten-\ntially push the performance even further.

This allows us to answer the following\nquestions:\n1. Question: Does BERT really need such\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\nAnswer: Yes, BERT BASE achieves almost\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\n2.

How-\never, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM\nmodel begins to outperform the LTR model\nalmost immediately.\nC.2 Ablation for Different Masking\nProcedures\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a\nmixed strategy for masking the target tokens when\npre-training with the masked language model\n(MLM) objective.

The x-axis is the value of k.Note that the purpose of the masking strategies\nis to reduce the mismatch between pre-training\nand ﬁne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-\npears during the ﬁne-tuning stage. We report the\nDev results for both MNLI and NER. For ', 'scheme, and hyperpa-\nrameters as BERT BASE :\nNo NSP : A bidirectional model which is trained\nusing the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the\n“next sentence prediction” (NSP) task.\nLTR & No NSP : A left-context-only model which\nis trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR)\nLM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since ']","In MLM, a percentage of input tokens are masked randomly, and the model predicts these masked tokens based on their context.","BERT uses the 'masked LM' (MLM) for its pre-training by masking some of the target tokens in the input sentences and then predicting them based on the context provided by the surrounding tokens.

Discuss the impact of model size on BERT's performance across different tasks.,"['in\nour training data.\n5.3. Bi-directional Transformer Results Using BERT\nIn this section, we apply our methodology to BERT-style\ntransformer models and study the effect of model scaling\non several downstream tasks. Prior work (Lan et al., 2019)\nfound that increasing model size beyond BERT-large with\n336M parameters results in unexpected model degradation.\nTo address this degradation, the authors of that work (Lan\net al., 2019) introduced parameter sharing and showed that\nthat their models scale much better compared to the original\nBERT model.\nWe further investigated this behaviour and empirically\ndemonstrated that rearranging the order of the layer nor-\nmalization and the residual connections as shown in Figure\n7 is critical to enable the scaling of the BERT-style mod-\nels beyond BERT-Large. The architecture (b) in Figure 7\neliminates instabilities observed using the original BERT\narchitecture in (a) and also has a lower training loss.

We trained a number\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\ncedure as described previously.\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\ning examples, and is substantially different from\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\ntains 340M parameters.\nIt has long been known that increasing the\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\ningly that scaling to extreme model ']","Larger BERT models consistently show better performance across tasks, indicating the importance of model size in achieving high accuracy.","Increasing the model size of BERT has shown to have a significant impact on its performance across different tasks. In the study, larger BERT models with more layers, hidden units, and attention heads led to a strict accuracy improvement on various tasks, including MRPC, even with limited labeled training examples. The results also showcased that larger models outperformed smaller ones across all four datasets in the GLUE tasks.

Moreover, the comparison of different Transformer models highlighted the continuous improvement in performance with larger model sizes. The study demonstrated that increasing the model size beyond BERT-Large resulted in unexpected model degradation, but by introducing parameter sharing and rearranging the order of layer normalization and residual connections, BERT-style models could scale better. This adjustment enabled the training of larger BERT models, leading to improved performance on downstream tasks.

Overall, the impact of model size on BERT's performance is evident, with larger models consistently showing better results on various tasks compared to smaller models. The study also emphasized the importance of scaling to extreme model sizes for achieving significant improvements in performance.",1.0,1.0,0.876833438873291

Conclusion and Future Work\nLarge language models demonstrate impressive few-shot\nlearning capabilities that arise from simply training on large-\nscale internet text. With the open-source release of LLMs—\nand their associated pre-training datasets—the research com-\nmunity can now begin to understand the origins of these\ncapabilities.

We are personally excited about im-\nproving retrieval-augmented LMs, especially with regards\nto their efficiency and retrieval accuracy. Moreover, our\nwork focuses on knowledge learning as it relates to fac-\ntoid question answering, but we leave open the question\nas to whether similar relationships exist for other types of\n8\x0cLarge Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge\ntasks, be it knowledge-intensive or otherwise. Relatedly,\neven though our work analyzes the impact of memorization\non question answering, our results may have implications\nfor other tasks that require using (or avoiding) memorized\nknowledge, e.g., analyzing private text, performing com-\nmonsense reasoning, or predicting source code. Finally, we\nhope that future evaluations of few-shot learning can con-\ntinue to shed light into model behavior by tracing accuracy\nback to properties of the pre-training data. In particular, our\nwork ', 'coreference challenges, which people usually construct intentionally\nto test language models’ ability, are seldom seen in the self-supervised corpus that makes up peo-\nple’s daily written texts.

Describe the methodology used for evaluating models on the multitask test.

The test\ncovers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,\nlaw, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability. We ﬁnd that while most recent\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.\nBy comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and\nprofessional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many\ntasks and to identify important shortcomings.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of\nrecently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance\nfor language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the\nactual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP\ntasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings\nof GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difﬁcult tasks (Wang et al.,\n2019). About ', 'One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,”\nconsisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-deﬁned tasks that\nrequire models to interact with ﬂexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.\nThe Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask\nNLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have\nacquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This\n7\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nprocess is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the\ndownstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up\nfrom reading the same text.\nThis motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how\nhumans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large\nquestion bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk\nabout the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,\nsuch as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum , but there are fewer than 5,000\nmultistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number\nof practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.\nFor this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide\na dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be\nused for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set ']","Models were evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings to measure their ability to apply pretraining knowledge without further fine-tuning, a method designed to be more akin to human learning and evaluation processes.","The methodology used for evaluating models on the multitask test involves assessing pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting. In this approach, models are not trained on large question banks but are assumed to have acquired knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the internet. This process is similar to how humans learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk about the topic. 

This methodology differs from traditional model evaluations in that it emphasizes the importance of pretraining models to acquire knowledge from reading text rather than learning from a large question bank. Additionally, the multitask test provides a dev set for few-shot prompts, a val set for hyperparameter tuning, and a test set to evaluate the models' performance across multiple tasks. This approach aims to assess models based on their ability to possess extensive world knowledge and problem-solving abilities rather than relying solely on large training sets.",0.6,1.0,0.4183487296104431
What characteristic of large language model (LLM) generated text's probability function does DetectGPT exploit for detection?,"['DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection\nusing Probability Curvature\nEric Mitchell1Yoonho Lee1Alexander Khazatsky1Christopher D. Manning1Chelsea Finn1\nAbstract\nThe increasing fluency and widespread usage of\nlarge language models (LLMs) highlight the de-\nsirability of corresponding tools aiding detection\nof LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify\na property of the structure of an LLM’s proba-\nbility function that is useful for such detection.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that text sampled\nfrom an LLM tends to occupy negative curva-\nture regions of the model’s log probability func-\ntion. Leveraging this observation, we then define\na new curvature-based criterion for judging if a\npassage is generated from a given LLM. This\napproach, which we call DetectGPT, does not re-\nquire training a separate classifier, collecting a\ndataset of real or generated passages, or explic-\nitly watermarking generated text. It uses only\nlog probabilities computed by the model of in-\nterest and random perturbations of the passage\nfrom another generic pre-trained language model\n(e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discrimi-\nnative than existing zero-shot methods for model\nsample detection, notably improving detection of\nfake news articles generated by 20B parameter\nGPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest\nzero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for Detect-\nGPT.

Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have proven able to gen-\nerate remarkably fluent responses to a wide variety of user\nqueries. Models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022), and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022)\ncan convincingly answer complex questions about science,\nmathematics, historical and current events, and social trends.\n1Stanford University.

Our\nwork does not assume text is generated with the goal of easy\ndetection; DetectGPT detects text generated from publicly\navailable LLMs using standard LLM sampling strategies.\nThe widespread use of LLMs has led to much other con-\ntemporaneous work on detecting LLM output. Sadasivan\net al. (2023) show that the detection AUROC of the an de-\ntector is upper bounded by a function of the TV distance\nbetween the model and human text. However, we find that\nAUROC of DetectGPT is high even for the largest publicly-\navailable models (Table 2), suggesting that TV distance may\nnot correlate strongly with model scale and capability. This\ndisconnect may be exacerbated by new training objectives\nother than maximum likelihood, e.g., reinforcement learn-\ning with human feedback (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler\net al., 2020). Both Sadasivan et al. (2023) and Krishna et al.\n(2023) show the effectiveness of paraphrasing as a tool for\nevading detection, suggesting an important area of study\nfor future work. Liang et al. (2023) show that multi-lingual\ndetection is difficult, with non-DetectGPT detectors show-\ning bias against non-native speakers; this result highlights\nthe advantage of zero-shot detectors like DetectGPT, which\ngeneralize well to any data generated by the original gener-\nating model. Mireshghallah et al. (2023) study which proxy\nscoring models produce the most useful log probabilities\nfor detection when the generating model is not known (a\nlarge-scale version of our Figure 6). Surprisingly (but con-\nsistent with our findings), they find that smaller models are\nin fact better proxy models for performing detection with\nperturbation-based methods like DetectGPT.\nThe problem of machine-generated text detection echoes ear-\nlier work on detecting deepfakes, artificial images or videos\ngenerated by deep nets, which ']",DetectGPT exploits the characteristic that LLM-generated text tends to lie in regions of negative curvature of the model's log probability function.,DetectGPT exploits the characteristic that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function.,1.0,1.0,0.9359040260314941

Figure 9 shows the perturbation discrepancy dis-\ntributions for model-generated and human texts across four\ndata distributions, using GPT-Neo-2.7B to generate sam-\nples. A threshold of slightly below 0.1 separates human and\nmodel texts across data distributions, which is important for\npractical scenarios in which a passage may be analyzed with-\nout knowing its domain a priori. Finally, Figure 10 shows an\nanalysis of DetectGPT’s performance as a function of pas-\nsage length. We bin the paired human- and model-generated\nsequences by their average length into three bins of equal\nsize (bottom/middle/top third), and plot the AUROC within\neach bin. The relationship between detection performance\nand passage length generally depends on the dataset and\nmodel (or tokenizer). For very long sequences, DetectGPT\nmay see reduced performance because our implementation\nof DetectGPT applies all T5 mask-filling perturbations at\nonce, and T5 may fail to track many mask tokens at once.\nBy applying perturbations in multiple sequential rounds of\nsmaller numbers of masks, this effect may be mitigated.\n6. Discussion\nAs large language models continue to improve, they will\nbecome increasingly attractive tools for replacing human\nwriters in a variety of contexts, such as education, jour-\nnalism, and art.

Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other.

The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora\nincluding educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information\nabout a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information\nfrom pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively\nmeasured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used ﬁne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).\nHowever, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 ']","The findings highlighted that while recent models like GPT-3 have made progress, they exhibit lopsided performance across different subjects, lack expert-level accuracy, and struggle with procedural knowledge and tasks requiring calculations.","The key findings regarding the models' performance on the multitask test were that while the largest GPT-3 model showed improvement over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average, it still needed substantial improvements to reach expert-level accuracy on all 57 tasks. The models also had lopsided performance, with high accuracy on some subjects but near-random accuracy on others, such as physics, mathematics, law, and morality. Additionally, the models did not have an accurate sense of what they did or did not know, with their average confidence sometimes being significantly off from their actual accuracy.",1.0,1.0,0.6576908826828003
How does DetectGPT perform in comparison to the strongest zero-shot baseline when detecting fake news articles generated by GPT-NeoX?,"['DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection\nusing Probability Curvature\nEric Mitchell1Yoonho Lee1Alexander Khazatsky1Christopher D. Manning1Chelsea Finn1\nAbstract\nThe increasing fluency and widespread usage of\nlarge language models (LLMs) highlight the de-\nsirability of corresponding tools aiding detection\nof LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify\na property of the structure of an LLM’s proba-\nbility function that is useful for such detection.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that text sampled\nfrom an LLM tends to occupy negative curva-\nture regions of the model’s log probability func-\ntion. Leveraging this observation, we then define\na new curvature-based criterion for judging if a\npassage is generated from a given LLM. This\napproach, which we call DetectGPT, does not re-\nquire training a separate classifier, collecting a\ndataset of real or generated passages, or explic-\nitly watermarking generated text. It uses only\nlog probabilities computed by the model of in-\nterest and random perturbations of the passage\nfrom another generic pre-trained language model\n(e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discrimi-\nnative than existing zero-shot methods for model\nsample detection, notably improving detection of\nfake news articles generated by 20B parameter\nGPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest\nzero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for Detect-\nGPT.

How does DistilBERT's performance on the GLUE benchmark compare to BERT and ELMo?,"['recent work in this area.\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT\nachieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters\net al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the\nword level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of\nnon-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models\non GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as\nwell as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed\ntransformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in\nisolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary\nmethods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can\nbe improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate\ndata-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and\nBach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task ﬁnetuning and using massive\namounts of weak supervision. Clark et al.

The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al.

To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings ']","NSP involves predicting whether a sentence B is the actual next sentence that follows sentence A, facilitating understanding of sentence relationships.","The Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task in BERT is a binary classification loss used to predict whether two segments of text follow each other in the original text.

The purpose of the NSP task is to improve performance on downstream tasks, such as Natural Language Inference, which require reasoning about the relationships between pairs of sentences.

These few-shot\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\nthe preferred model is not the ', 'suggests that high-quality language data is\nlikelyexhaustedbefore2026,andlow-qualitylanguageand\nimage data could be run out by 2060.

Furthermore,\nas better-quality data is assumed to train language models\nwith better performances, companies and independent\nresearchers are spending more time on data curation.However, this can not be done easily under the low-\nresource and low-budget scenarios.

How does the accuracy of the largest GPT-3 model compare to human professionals across the 57 tasks?,"['57tasks. On the right are UniﬁedQA\ntransfer accuracies for all of the 57tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.\nA.1 A NALYSIS WITH MORE FINE-TUNED MODELS\nWe primarily analyzed models with more than 10billion parameters in the main body of the paper.\nFor this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu\n11\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\net al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million\nparameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are ﬁne-tuned to predict one of four classes using the\nUniﬁedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.\nWe observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains\nan overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9%accuracy for the humanities, 28.8%for social sciences,\n27.0%for STEM, and 27.7%for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%\naccuracy for the humanities, 25.7%for the social sciences, 27.7%for STEM, and 27.9%for other.\nGPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8%accuracy for the humanities, 33.3%for the social\nsciences, 30.2%for STEM, and 33.1%for other.\nCompare this to UniﬁedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60million parameters and approximately\n29.3%accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer\nparameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,\nUniﬁedQA with 3billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5\nbillion parameters attains 32.4%accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset\nsize (and therefore UniﬁedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nWe qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high conﬁdence mistakes. We ﬁnd that while many of\nthese mistakes were clearly wrong, ', 'we ﬁnd that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost\n70% accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.\nOur results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-of-the-art models still\nstruggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining. The tasks with near-random accuracy\ninclude calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human\nvalues such as law and morality. This second weakness is particularly concerning because it will\nbe important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical.\nWorryingly, we also ﬁnd that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know\nsince its average conﬁdence can be up to 24% off from its actual accuracy. We comprehensively\nevaluate the breadth and depth of a model’s text understanding by covering numerous topics that\nhumans are incentivized to learn. Since our test consists in 57tasks, it can be used to analyze\naggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings. The test and code is\navailable at github.com/hendrycks/test.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nPretraining. The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora\nincluding educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information\nabout a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information\nfrom pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively\nmeasured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.\nUntil recently, researchers primarily used ﬁne-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).\nHowever, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 ']","he largest GPT-3 model achieves 43.9% accuracy on average, significantly below the expert-level performance, indicating that even the most advanced models require substantial improvements to reach human professional accuracy levels across these tasks.",None,1.0,0.0,-0.00460747629404068
What can you say about the calibration of models like GPT-3 in relation to their confidence and accuracy on the multitask test?,"['way, our test shows that GPT-3 has\nmany knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.\nCalibration. We should not trust a model’s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning\nthat its conﬁdence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However,\nlarge neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et al., 2017), especially under distribution shift\n(Ovadia et al., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average conﬁdence\nestimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates\nthat GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its conﬁdence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in\nthe zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and conﬁdence reaching up to 24%\nfor some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error\n(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Kumar et al., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as\nElementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only\nsomewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest\nthat model calibration has wide room for improvement.\n5 D ISCUSSION\nMultimodal Understanding. While text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts\nabout the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as\nimages, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et al., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as\nGPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse\narray of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs,\nbenchmarks should be designed to reﬂect this change. ', 'shows that the largest GPT-3\nmodel has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of\nabout 37.7%. Brown et al. (2020) also observe\nthat larger GPT-3 models perform better, though\nprogress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we\nshow that non-random accuracy on the multitask\ntest emerged with recent large few-shot models\ncompared to datasets that assess commonsense\nand linguistic understanding.\nTo test the usefulness of ﬁne-tuning instead of\nfew-shot learning, we also evaluate UniﬁedQA\nmodels. UniﬁedQA has the advantage of being\nﬁne-tuned on other question answering datasets,\nunlike GPT-3. We assess UniﬁedQA by evalu-\nating its transfer performance without any ad-\nditional ﬁne-tuning. The largest UniﬁedQA\nmodel we test has 11billion parameters, which\nis slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Neverthe-\nless, we show in Table 1 that it attains 48.9%\naccuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite UniﬁedQA have\nan order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also ﬁnd that even the smallest UniﬁedQA variant,\nwith just 60million parameters, has approximately 29.3%accuracy. These results suggest that while\nmodel size is a key component for achieving strong performance, ﬁne-tuning also helps.\nComparing Disciplines. Using our test, we discover that GPT-3 and UniﬁedQA have lopsided\nperformance and several substantial knowledge gaps. Figure 6 shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (few-\nshot) and UniﬁedQA for all 57tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance\nfor all tasks, with GPT-3’s accuracy ranging from 69% for US Foreign Policy to 26% for College\nChemistry. UniﬁedQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of 82.5%.\nOverall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems. Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy\nSTEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects. For GPT-3, 9out of the 10\n6\x0cPublished as a ']","Models like GPT-3 are poorly calibrated, with their confidence often not accurately reflecting their actual performance across different subjects, indicating a need for improvement in model calibration techniques.","The calibration of models like GPT-3 in relation to their confidence and accuracy on the multitask test is not good.

The difference between its accuracy and confidence can reach up to 24% for some subjects, indicating that the model's confidence estimates are not reliable. Additionally, the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error for tasks like Elementary Mathematics is high, further highlighting the miscalibration of predictions. Overall, there is wide room for improvement in model calibration.",1.0,0.8,0.7104010581970215

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ']","DistilBERT omits token-type embeddings and the pooler layer, and reduces the number of layers by half compared to BERT.","The specific architectural change made to develop DistilBERT from BERT was the introduction of a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation, and cosine-distance losses during the pre-training phase.

What core challenge does HellaSwag aim to address in the context of state-of-the-art models' capabilities in commonsense natural language inference (NLI)?,"['seriously\nconsidered. At the deployment stage, we note that LLMs\ncould be attacked to output malicious content or decisions,\nby unethical users [15, 29]. Thus, even internally ethical\nlanguage models can be used unethically by third parties.\nExisting strategies [81, 82] have demonstrated the effec-\ntiveness of preventing LLM abuse, though they can be\ninvalid via attacks [83]. We, therefore, encourage future\nworks to explore more feasible protections for language\nmodels. From the daily usage perspective, the users should\nbe fully aware of the shortcomings of the language model’s\napplication, and not abuse or attack language models\nfor performing unethical tasks. Most of the unethical\nbehaviors towards language models are deemed a great\nchallenge for the LLM producers, as they are almost\nunpredictable. Consequently, we would like to call for the\neducation and policy of model usage in the community.\nSpecifically, courses for proper machine learning model\nusage should be developed for guiding users to learn ‘Dos’\nand Dont’ in AI. Detailed policies could also be proposed\nto list all user’s responsibilities before the model access.\nC. Language Models Beyond ChatGPT\nThe examination of ethical implications associated with\nlanguage models necessitates a comprehensive examina-\ntion of the broader challenges that arise within the domain\x0cof language models, in light of recent advancements in\nthe field of artificial intelligence. The last decade has seen\na rapid evolution of AI techniques, characterized by an\nexponential increase in the size and complexity of AI\nmodels, and a concomitant scale-up of model parameters.\nThe scaling laws that govern the development of language\nmodels,asdocumentedinrecentliterature[84,85],suggest\nthatwecanexpecttoencounterevenmoreexpansivemod-\nels that incorporate multiple modalities in the near future.\nEfforts to integrate multiple modalities into a single model\nare driven by the ultimate goal of realizing the concept of\nfoundation models [86]. ', 'Using exploratory studies via model inference,\nadversarial robustness, and privacy, for instance, early\nresearch revealed that dialogue-focused language models\nposed possible ethical issues [21]. Several recent studies\nhave demonstrated that LLMs, such as GPT-3, have a\npersistent bias against genders [22] and religions [23].\nExpectedly, LLMs may also encode toxicity, which results\nin ethical harms. For instance, Si et al. [24] demonstrated\nthat BlenderBot[25] and TwitterBot [26] can easily trigger\ntoxic responses, though with low toxicity.\nDespite current studies on NLP and ethical risks and\neffects, the following gaps in earlier research exist:\n•Practice: Many studies on AI ethics have been con-\nducted theoretically and may not accurately reflect\nthe real-world ethical risks.\n•Timeliness: The rapid advancements in NLP have\nresulted in a lack of examination of more recent\nlanguage models from an ethical perspective.arXiv:2301.12867v4 [cs.CL] 29 May 2023\x0c•Agreement: There is a lack of consensus among\ndaily users regarding the ethical risks associated with\ncurrent advanced language model applications.\n•Comprehensiveness: Most studies have a narrow focus\non the measurement of selected ethical issues and fail\nto address all ethical considerations comprehensively.\nIn this study, we aim to address these deficiencies by\npresenting a comprehensive qualitative exploration and\ncatalog of ethical dilemmas and risks in ChatGPT, a\nrecently launched practical language model from Ope-\nnAI.

This allows DetectGPT to define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM without requiring training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful.

In the experiments above, we observe that GLM-130B’s performance\ngrowth (13.31 to 15.12) with the increase of few-shot samples is not as significant as GPT-3’s (4.35\nto 13.18).

To correct the bias, a potential solution we came\nup with would be to employ MIP with varied shots of in-context samples rather than only zero-shot\nsamples.\nFinally, despite almost the same GPT architecture as GPT-3, PaLM 540B’s relative growth with few-\nshot in-context learning is substantially more significant than GPT-3’s.

Describe RoBERTa's approach to training with large mini-batches and its effect on model optimization and performance.,"['RoBERTa is trained with dynamic mask-\ning (Section 4.1),FULL -SENTENCES without NSP\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\nAdditionally, we investigate two other impor-\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\narchitecture ( Yang et al. ,2019 ) is pretrained us-\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\nBERT ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ). It is also trained with\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT.\nTo help disentangle the importance of these fac-\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERTa\nfollowing the BERT LARGE architecture ( L= 24 ,\nH= 1024 ,A= 16 , 355M parameters).

The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does.

Our\nsmaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its\ncapabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a\ncomparative on-device study.\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1: Parameter counts of several recently released\npretrained language models.The last two years have seen the rise\nof Transfer Learning approaches in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nwith large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels becoming a basic tool in\nmany NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2018,\nRadford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019].\nWhile these models lead to signiﬁ-\ncant improvement, they often have\nseveral hundred million parameters\nand current research1on pre-trained\nmodels indicates that training even\nlarger models still leads to better per-\nformances on downstream tasks.\nThe trend toward bigger models\nraises several concerns. First is the\nenvironmental cost of exponentially ', 'inference speed\nTo further investigate the speed-up/size trade-off of DistilBERT, we compare (in Table 3) the number\nof parameters of each model along with the inference time needed to do a full pass on the STS-\nB development set on CPU (Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 Haswell @2.9GHz) using a batch size of 1.\nDistilBERT has 40% fewer parameters than BERT and is 60% faster than BERT.\nOn device computation We studied whether DistilBERT could be used for on-the-edge applications\nby building a mobile application for question answering. We compare the average inference time on\na recent smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) against our previously trained question answering model based\non BERT-base. Excluding the tokenization step, DistilBERT is 71% faster than BERT, and the whole\nmodel weighs 207 MB (which could be further reduced with quantization). Our code is available5.\n4.2 Ablation study\nIn this section, we investigate the inﬂuence of various components of the triple loss and the student\ninitialization on the performances of the distilled model. We report the macro-score on GLUE. Table 4\npresents the deltas with the full triple loss: removing the Masked Language Modeling loss has little\nimpact while the two distillation losses account for a large portion of the performance.\n5 Related work\nTask-speciﬁc distillation Most of the prior works focus on building task-speciﬁc distillation se-\ntups.

How does RoBERTa's use of a byte-level BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) vocabulary contribute to its model architecture and performance?,"['diverse cor-\npora, such as the ones considered in this work.\nRadford et al. (2019 ) introduce a clever imple-\nmentation of BPE that uses bytes instead of uni-\ncode characters as the base subword units. Using\nbytes makes it possible to learn a subword vocab-\nulary of a modest size (50K units) that can still en-\ncode any input text without introducing any “un-\nknown” tokens.\n8Large batch training can improve training efﬁciency even\nwithout large scale parallel hardware through gradient ac-\ncumulation , whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches\nare accumulated locally before each optimization step. Thi s\nfunctionality is supported natively in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al. ,\n2019 ).The original BERT implementa-\ntion ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ) uses a character-level\nBPE vocabulary of size 30K, which is learned\nafter preprocessing the input with heuristic tok-\nenization rules. Following Radford et al. (2019 ),\nwe instead consider training BERT with a larger\nbyte-level BPE vocabulary containing 50K sub-\nword units, without any additional preprocessing\nor tokenization of the input.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers.

These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream ']","RoBERTa adopts a byte-level BPE vocabulary, allowing for more efficient handling of large and diverse corpora without the need for additional preprocessing or tokenization.

Given a dataset with ground-truth labels and a\nloss function deﬁned over those labels, we process images\nthrough a “probe network” and compute an embedding\nbased on estimates of the Fisher information matrix asso-\nciated with the probe network parameters. This provides a\nﬁxed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent\nof details such as the number of classes and does not require\nany understanding of the class label semantics. We demon-\nstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task sim-\nilarities that match our intuition about semantic and tax-\nonomic relations between different visual tasks ( e.g., tasks\nbased on classifying different types of plants are similar).\nWe also demonstrate the practical value of this framework\nfor the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor\nfor a new task. We present a simple meta-learning frame-\nwork for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of\npredicting which feature extractors will perform well. Se-\nlecting a feature extractor with task embedding obtains a\nperformance close to the best available feature extractor,\nwhile costing substantially less than exhaustively training\nand evaluating on all available feature extractors.\n1.

In this paper we present\nSuperGLUE, a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difﬁ-\ncult language understanding tasks, a software toolkit, and a public leaderboard.\nSuperGLUE is available at super.gluebenchmark.com .\n1 Introduction\nRecently there has been notable progress across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, led\nby methods such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2019). The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is\na collection of nine language understanding tasks built on existing public datasets, together with\nprivate test data, an evaluation server, a single-number ']"," SuperGLUE uses a single-number metric averaging task scores to simplify comparison across models, aiming to provide a clear, comprehensive measure of progress on a wide range of language understanding tasks.","SuperGLUE's scoring system consists of a public leaderboard with eight language understanding tasks, including more challenging tasks than GLUE, and diverse task formats such as coreference resolution and question answering. It aims to provide a more rigorous test of language understanding and to measure progress towards general-purpose language understanding technologies for English. The benchmark includes human performance estimates for all tasks to show the headroom between a strong baseline and human performance. Additionally, SuperGLUE is distributed with a modular toolkit for pretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, using standard tools like PyTorch and AllenNLP. It also has refined usage rules to ensure fair competition on the leaderboard.",1.0,1.0,0.8761801719665527

Given a dataset with ground-truth labels and a\nloss function deﬁned over those labels, we process images\nthrough a “probe network” and compute an embedding\nbased on estimates of the Fisher information matrix asso-\nciated with the probe network parameters. This provides a\nﬁxed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent\nof details such as the number of classes and does not require\nany understanding of the class label semantics. We demon-\nstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task sim-\nilarities that match our intuition about semantic and tax-\nonomic relations between different visual tasks ( e.g., tasks\nbased on classifying different types of plants are similar).\nWe also demonstrate the practical value of this framework\nfor the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor\nfor a new task. We present a simple meta-learning frame-\nwork for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of\npredicting which feature extractors will perform well. Se-\nlecting a feature extractor with task embedding obtains a\nperformance close to the best available feature extractor,\nwhile costing substantially less than exhaustively training\nand evaluating on all available feature extractors.\n1. Introduction\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK 2VEC\nembedding, a technique to ']",Task2Vec is designed for selecting the most suitable pre-trained feature extractor for a new task by learning a metric on task embeddings to predict feature extractor performance.,"Task2Vec is particularly designed to optimize the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor for a new task.

In what way does Task2Vec's asymmetric distance measure contribute to task similarity assessment and model selection?,"['the division\nis element-wise. This is a symmetric distance which we ex-\npect to capture semantic similarity between two tasks. For\nexample, we show in Fig. 2 that it correlates well with the\ntaxonomical distance between species on iNaturalist.\nOn the other hand, precisely for this reason, this distance\nis ill-suited for tasks such as model selection, where the (in-\ntrinsically asymmetric) transfer distance is more relevant.\nAsymmetric TASK 2VEC distance In a ﬁrst approxima-\ntion, that does not consider either the model or the training\nprocedure used, positive transfer between two tasks depends\nboth on the similarity between two tasks and on the com-\nplexity of the ﬁrst. Indeed, pre-training on a general but\ncomplex task such as ImageNet often yields a better result\nthan ﬁne-tuning from a close dataset of comparable com-\nplexity. In our case, complexity can be measured as the dis-\ntance from the trivial embedding. This suggests the follow-\ning asymmetric score, again improperly called a “distance”\ndespite being asymmetric and possibly negative:\ndasym(ta→tb) =dsym(ta,tb)−αdsym(ta,t0),\nwheret0is the trivial embedding, and αis an hyperparam-\neter. This has the effect of bring more complex models\ncloser. The hyper-parameter αcan be selected based on\nthe meta-task. In our experiments, we found that the best\nvalue ofα(α= 0.15when using a ResNet-34 pretrained\non ImageNet as the probe network) is robust to the choice\nof meta-tasks.\n4.MODEL 2VEC: task/model co-embedding\nBy construction, the TASK 2VEC distance ignores details\nof the model and only relies on the task. If we know what\ntask a model was trained on, we can represent the model by\nthe embedding of that task. However, in general we may\nnot have such information ( e.g., black-box models or hand-\nconstructed feature extractors).

What specific properties of Task2Vec embeddings allow for effective reasoning about task space?,"['on each task.\nA similar approach has been taken in computer vision for\nselecting a detector for a new category out of a large library\nof detectors [26, 40, 38].\n7. Discussion\nTASK 2VEC is an efﬁcient way to represent a task, or the\ncorresponding dataset, as a ﬁxed dimensional vector. It has\nseveral appealing properties, in particular its norm corre-\nlates with the test error obtained on the task, and the co-\nsine distance between embeddings correlates with natural\ndistances between tasks, when available, such as the taxo-\nnomic distance for species classiﬁcation, and the ﬁne-tuning\ndistance for transfer learning. Having a representation of\ntasks paves the way for a wide variety of meta-learning\ntasks. In this work, we focused on selection of an expert\nfeature extractor in order to solve a new task, especially\nwhen little training data is present, and showed that using\nTASK 2VEC to select an expert from a collection can sen-\nsibly improve test performance while adding only a small\noverhead to the training process.\x0cMeta-learning on the space of tasks is an important step\ntoward general artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we in-\ntroduce a way of dealing with thousands of tasks, enough to\nenable reconstruct a topology on the task space, and to test\nmeta-learning solutions. The current experiments highlight\nthe usefulness of our methods. Even so, our collection does\nnot capture the full complexity and variety of tasks that one\nmay encounter in real-world situations. Future work should\nfurther test effectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the\nembedding on larger and more diverse collections.\nReferences\n[1] iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 workshop,\nCVPR 2018. https://www.kaggle.com/c/\nimaterialist-challenge-fashion-2018 .\n5\n[2] S.

Table 1 summarizes the comparison\nbetween GLM-130B, GPT-3 and another two open-source efforts—OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B,\nas well as PaLM 540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)—a 4 ×larger model—as a reference.\nAltogether, the conceptual uniqueness and engineering efforts enable GLM-130B to exhibit perfor-\nmance that surpasses the level of GPT-3 on a wide range of benchmarks (in total 112 tasks) and also\noutperforms PaLM 540B in many cases, while outperformance over GPT-3 has not been observed in\nOPT-175B and BLOOM-176B (Cf. Figure 1 left). For zero-shot performance, GLM-130B is better\nthan GPT-3 175B (+5.0%), OPT-175B (+6.5%), and BLOOM-176B (+13.0%) on LAMBADA (Pa-\nperno et al., 2016), and achieves 3 ×better performance than GPT-3 on Big-bench-lite (Srivastava\net al., 2022). For the 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) tasks, it is better than GPT-3 175B\n(+0.9%) and BLOOM-176B (+12.7%). As a bilingual LLM also in Chinese, it offers significantly\nbetter results than ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B (Wang et al., 2021)—the largest Chinese LLM—on 7\nzero-shot CLUE (Xu et al., 2020) datasets (+24.26%) and 5 zero-shot FewCLUE (Xu et al., 2021)\nones (+12.75%). Importantly, as summarized in Figure 1 right, GLM-130B as an open model is\nassociated with significantly less bias and generation toxicity than its 100B-scale counterparts .\nFinally, we design GLM-130B to empower as many people as possible to conduct 100B-scale LLM\nstudies.

We aim to enable our 100B-scale LLM to run a single DGX-A100\n(40G) node in FP16 precision. Based on the hidden state dimension of 12,288 we adopt from\nGPT-3, the resultant model size has to be no more than 130B parameters, thus GLM-130B. To\nmaximize GPU utilization, we configure the model based on the platform and its corresponding\nparallel strategy. To avoid insufficient memory utilization in the middle stages due to the additional\nword embedding at both ends, we balance the pipeline partition by removing one layer from them,\nmaking 9 ×8-2=70 transformer layers in GLM-130B.\nDuring the 60-day access to the cluster, we manage to train GLM-130B for 400 billion tokens\n(roughly 200 billion each for Chinese and English) with a fixed sequence length of 2,048 per sample.\nFor the [gMASK] training objective, we use a context window of 2,048 tokens. For the [MASK]\nand multi-task objectives, we use a context window of 512 and concatenate four samples together to\ncater the 2,048-sequence-length.

Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter.

We demonstrate this synergy between a\nneural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13\nmathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reason-\ning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other bench-\nmarks.

How does the inclusion of specific metadata in CodeNet facilitate a wide range of code analysis tasks?,"['related datasets.\nLarge scale. A useful dataset should contain a large number and variety of data samples to expose\nthe realistic and complex landscape of data distributions one meets in practice. CodeNet is the\nlargest dataset in its class - it has approximately 10 times more code samples than GCJ and its C++\nbenchmark is approximately 10 times larger than POJ-104.\nRich annotation. For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems. This information is made available as part of the\ndataset release but it is absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\n5 Construction of CodeNet\n5.1 Collection of Code Samples\nThe CodeNet ', 'requirements change, make it more secure, and/or comply with regu-\nlations.

In this paper, we present ""CodeNet"", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind dataset in scale, diversity,\nand quality, to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code.\nTo promote widespread adoption of CodeNet, we will be launching contests involving use cases based\non the dataset. The ﬁrst contest [ 6] will focus on diversity, inclusion and spurring interest among\naspiring data scientists. We are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization (with\npresence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [ 7] and targeting teams with at least\nﬁfty percent women. We are planning follow-up contests that target experienced AI practitioners.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the CodeNet dataset. Related\ndatasets are discussed in Section 3, and the differentiation of CodeNet with respect to these related\ndatasets is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 describes how CodeNet was curated and Section 6\nenumerates the usability features of CodeNet with several pre-processing tools to transform source\ncodes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models. Section 7\ndiscusses the upcoming CodeNet contest and Section 8 describes important baseline experiments\nwith the CodeNet dataset.

Can PAL's approach be generalized to models trained primarily on natural language rather than code?,"['PAL: Program-aided Language Models\nLuyu Gao* 1Aman Madaan* 1Shuyan Zhou* 1Uri Alon1Pengfei Liu1 2Yiming Yang1Jamie Callan1\nGraham Neubig1 2\n{luyug,amadaan,shuyanzh,ualon,pliu3,yiming,callan,gneubig }@cs.cmu.edu\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently\ndemonstrated an impressive ability to perform\narithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when\nprovided with a few examples at test time (“few-\nshot prompting”). Much of this success can be\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\nAided Language models ( PAL): a novel approach\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-\nlems and generate programs as the intermediate\nreasoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a\nruntime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL,\ndecomposing the natural language problem into\nrunnable steps remains the only learning task for\nthe LLM, while solving is delegated to the inter-\npreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a\nneural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13\nmathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reason-\ning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other bench-\nmarks. In all these natural language reasoning\ntasks, generating code using an LLM and rea-\nsoning using a Python interpreter leads to more\naccurate results than much larger models. For ex-\nample, PALusing CODEX achieves state-of-the-\nart few-shot accuracy on the GSM 8Kbenchmark\nof math word problems, surpassing PaLM-540 B\nwhich uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-\n1.

How does CodeNet's dataset size and diversity support advanced AI for code research compared to previous datasets?,"['requirements change, make it more secure, and/or comply with regu-\nlations. These tasks are challenging, and it is crucial to provide tool support for developers to be\nmore productive at performing them. It is well known that the latest advancements in deep learning\nalgorithms rely on best-of-breed datasets, such as ImageNet, to create increasingly complex and\npowerful models. In this paper, we present ""CodeNet"", a ﬁrst-of-its-kind dataset in scale, diversity,\nand quality, to accelerate the algorithmic advances in AI for Code.\nTo promote widespread adoption of CodeNet, we will be launching contests involving use cases based\non the dataset. The ﬁrst contest [ 6] will focus on diversity, inclusion and spurring interest among\naspiring data scientists. We are partnering with the Global Women in Data Science organization (with\npresence in over 50 countries) founded by Stanford University [ 7] and targeting teams with at least\nﬁfty percent women. We are planning follow-up contests that target experienced AI practitioners.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the CodeNet dataset. Related\ndatasets are discussed in Section 3, and the differentiation of CodeNet with respect to these related\ndatasets is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 describes how CodeNet was curated and Section 6\nenumerates the usability features of CodeNet with several pre-processing tools to transform source\ncodes into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models. Section 7\ndiscusses the upcoming CodeNet contest and Section 8 describes important baseline experiments\nwith the CodeNet dataset.

A useful dataset should contain a large number and variety of data samples to expose\nthe realistic and complex landscape of data distributions one meets in practice. CodeNet is the\nlargest dataset in its class - it has approximately 10 times more code samples than GCJ and its C++\nbenchmark is approximately 10 times larger than POJ-104.\nRich annotation. For the dataset class in question, it is important to include information beyond\nwhich problem a code sample solves to enable a wide range of applications and use cases. It is useful\nto know whether a code sample solves the problem correctly, and if not, the error category (e.g.,\ncompilation error, runtime error, and out-of-memory error). Since the source code is supposed to\nsolve a programming problem, it is advantageous to know the problem statement and have a sample\ninput for execution and a sample output for validation. All such extra information is part of CodeNet\nbut absent in GCJ and POJ-104.\nClean samples. For effective machine learning, the data samples are expected to be independent\nand identically distributed (iid); otherwise, the resulting performance metric could be signiﬁcantly\ninﬂated [ 24]. The existence of duplicate and/or near duplicate code samples makes the iid assumption\ndubious. Hence, it is crucial to identify the near duplicates. The presence of identical problems in the\ndataset poses an even bigger issue. In CodeNet, we analyzed the code samples for (near) duplication\nand used clustering to ﬁnd identical problems.
