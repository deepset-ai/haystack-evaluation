This becomes crucial in the context of evolving LLM capabilities and the potential for misuse. As LLMs become more advanced and are utilized in various applications, including language processing, content generation, and decision-making systems, there is a growing concern about the accuracy and trustworthiness of the outputs produced by these models.

DetectGPT's approach addresses the issue of potentially misleading or harmful text generated by LLMs by analyzing the text's similarity to the source model through perturbations and log probability comparison. This helps in identifying text that may be generated by the LLM but is not aligned with its intended functionality or may contain misleading information.

In the context of the potential for misuse of LLMs, such as spreading misinformation, generating biased content, or manipulating public opinion, DetectGPT's detection approach provides a means to verify the authenticity and reliability of text generated by these models. By highlighting discrepancies between the text and the source model's patterns, it can serve as a tool to flag potentially harmful or inaccurate content.

Overall, DetectGPT's detection approach plays a crucial role in ensuring the responsible use of LLMs, promoting transparency, and mitigating the risks associated with the misuse of these powerful language models in various applications.",1.0,1.0,0.7221709489822388

Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token. This helps BERT to learn contextual representations by predicting the masked tokens in the input sequence.",1.0,1.0,0.6122710704803467

This suggests that increasing the size of the model, with more hidden layers and a larger hidden size per attention head, can lead to improved performance on tasks. Additionally, larger models may require more training iterations to achieve optimal performance, as seen with the 3.9B model still training after 1.5 million iterations.

To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive\nworld knowledge and problem solving ability.

However, on every\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance\nand frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-\nrandom accuracy on some ', 'if only they were com-\npetent in properly reasoning about entailment rela-\ntions, then the meaning of NLI instructions would\nmatter.

Second, in preliminary experiments\n(Appendix K), our models actually zero-shot trans-\nfer reasonably well to HANS (McCoy et al., 2019),\na dataset designed to diagnoses models use of NLI\nheuristics.

What core challenge does HellaSwag aim to address in the context of state-of-the-art models' capabilities in commonsense natural language inference (NLI)?,"['right now.\nPut another way, for humans to answer Hella-\nSwag questions requires abstracting away from\nlanguage and modeling world states instead.

Describe the triple loss used in DistilBERT's training and its components.,"['of models.\nIn supervised learning, a classiﬁcation model is generally trained to predict an instance class by\nmaximizing the estimated probability of gold labels. A standard training objective thus involves\nminimizing the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the one-hot empirical\ndistribution of training labels. A model performing well on the training set will predict an output\ndistribution with high probability on the correct class and with near-zero probabilities on other\nclasses. But some of these ""near-zero"" probabilities are larger than others and reﬂect, in part, the\ngeneralization capabilities of the model and how well it will perform on the test set3.\nTraining loss The student is trained with a distillation loss over the soft target probabilities of\nthe teacher: Lce=∑\niti∗log(si)where ti(resp. si) is a probability estimated by the teacher\n(resp. the student). This objective results in ', 'a rich training signal by leveraging the full teacher\ndistribution. Following Hinton et al. [2015] we used a softmax-temperature :pi=exp(zi/T)∑\njexp(zj/T)\nwhere Tcontrols the smoothness of the output distribution and ziis the model score for the class i.\nThe same temperature Tis applied to the student and the teacher at training time, while at inference,\nTis set to 1 to recover a standard softmax .\nThe ﬁnal training objective is a linear combination of the distillation loss Lcewith the supervised\ntraining loss, in our case the masked language modeling lossLmlm [Devlin et al., 2018].

Optimization of this loss can be performed\neasily using Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes, and in particular using the local reparametrization trick of [18].\nThe prior precision λ2should be picked according to the scale of the weights of each layer. In practice, since the weights\nof each layer have a different scale, we found it useful to select a different λ2for each layer, and train it together with Λ,\nC. Details of the experiments\nC.1.

To that end, in designing SuperGLUE,\nwe identify the following desiderata of tasks in the benchmark:\nTask substance: Tasks should test a system’s ability to understand and reason about texts in English.\nTask difﬁculty: Tasks should be beyond the scope of current state-of-the-art systems, but solvable by\nmost college-educated English speakers. We exclude tasks that require domain-speciﬁc knowledge,\ne.g. medical notes or scientiﬁc papers.\nEvaluability: Tasks must have an automatic performance metric that ', 'requires understanding\nindividual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\nLicense: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research\npurposes.\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the\nNLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according\nto our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE.

To that end, in designing SuperGLUE,\nwe identify the following desiderata of tasks in the benchmark:\nTask substance: Tasks should test a system’s ability to understand and reason about texts in English.\nTask difﬁculty: Tasks should be beyond the scope of current state-of-the-art systems, but solvable by\nmost college-educated English speakers.

Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and\ninsufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining\ntasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either\ntoo challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks\nFollowing this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE.
