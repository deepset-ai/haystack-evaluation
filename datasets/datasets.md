# Datasets

ToDo:
- at least one should be financial or legal and raw data needs to be in structured pdfs
- at least one should be about support/help centre
- there should be one that has been used in other benchmarks (maybe based on wikipedia)
- they should all have a set of labels so that we can get performance metrics from them
